<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">I hope</span> the reader may find that this book, though
smaller than others on the same subject, is more
helpful and even more comprehensive than they
are; that it deals with the glass articles which they
mention and with others which they omit; that it
simplifies and classifies the study and practice of glass-collecting
more than has been done in print heretofore;
and that it can do these things because it is written
out of personal knowledge, gained from much experience,
and not from hearsay or from other books.</p>

<p>Diffuseness has been avoided, but this, I hope, has
enabled me to make the book the more lucid, as well as
the more succinct. At any rate, it affords hints,
general rules, and warnings more numerous and
more practical than any published until now; I have
also tried to give to it a quality which reviewers have
found present in my other books on Collecting&mdash;that
is, a simplicity and clearness of explanation, done
at the most difficult and necessary points, and in an
interesting way. Moreover, this book has had the great
advantage of revision (before printing) by Mr. G. F.
Collins, of 53 the Lanes, Brighton, a pupil of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Hartshorne’s, and well known to all principal collectors
of old glass. Most of the illustrations represent typical
pieces in my own collection, but for some of the finest
I have to thank the kindness of Mrs. Devitt, of Herontye,
East Grinstead, a collector indeed. The illustrations
do not represent relative sizes to the same scale.</p>

<h2><a name="I_OLD_ENGLISH_GLASSWARE" id="I_OLD_ENGLISH_GLASSWARE"></a>I. OLD ENGLISH GLASSWARE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> glassware made in England and Ireland
during the eighteenth and part of the nineteenth
century was the best of the kind ever
made. In quality, tint, feel, and ring the plain blown
glass was a beautiful product, and when it was cut or
engraved the decoration was done by fine craftsmen
and often with excellent taste. Old glass has its own
peculiar charm; the dark beauty of the crystal metal,
the variety of form, the bell-like ring when flipped, the
satiny feeling of the surface, the sparkle of the cut
facets, and the combination of gracefulness and usefulness
attract a collector: in cabinets it shines, gleams,
glows, and sparkles in a reticent, well-bred way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="captain" id="captain"></a><img src="images/i_001.jpg" width="600" height="296" alt="" />
<div class="caption">(1) MOULDED; (2) COTTON-WHITE; (3) CUT KNOPPED; AND
(4) CUT AND MOULDED CAPTAIN GLASSES</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there is attraction in the historical and social
traditions which have gathered around the ware;
romance lingers on in the Jacobite glasses, the Williamite
glasses, the Georgian glasses, the rummers and groggers
engraved and drunk from to celebrate the victories of
Nelson or famous elections; and humour resides in
many of the relics of the punch-bowl and six-bottle days.
To honour particular occasions one’s fine old glasses
may come out of the cabinet and be used at table
again; I know a collector of “captain glasses” who
brings them out for champagne. For decoration or in
use old glass has a refined, artistic, aristocratic air.</p>


<h3>NEITHER TOO RARE NOR TOO PLENTIFUL</h3>

<p>The sound of the past seems to throb in the ring of
this frail and dainty ware; at your touch the cry of
the bygone seems heard again. Because of fragility,
enough of eighteenth-century glass has not lasted on to
make it common, and yet so much of it is still extant
that a collector’s hunt for it is by no means a hopeless
quest. It may still be acquired at reasonable prices
from dealers in antiques, and a hunter for it in odd
corners, who buys in shillings, not in pounds, may
reasonably hope to pick up many fine specimens for
next to nothing even yet. Four years ago I bought a
fine drawn cordial glass for 2d. Within the past three
years I have myself bought a perfect captain glass for
3s. 6d.; within the last year I have bought six punch-lifters
for 17s. 6d. in all, uncommon as these bibulous
old siphons are. A large Bristol coloured-glass paper-weight
may cost you £3 in a dealer’s shop, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
three years ago they began to be a “rage,” but within the
past two years I have bought a Bristol glass article, equally
beautiful in colour and glass-flowers, and much rarer, for
2s. Footless coaching glasses and thistle-shaped fuddling
glasses are seldom seen, even on a dealer’s shelves, but
I have found one of each, in odd corners, for 6d.</p>


<h3>THE TIME TO COLLECT IS NOW</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i_003.jpg" width="417" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">WATERFORD GLASS ENGRAVED AND CUT:
NOTE THE FANLIKE EDGING AND THE
“STAR” CUT TO EDGE OF BASE; ALSO THE
DEEP CUTTING OF THE FLORAL ORNAMENT</div>
</div>

<p>Now, if ever, is the time to collect old glass rather
cheaply, for already the prices of it are mounting in
a remarkable way.
Thirty years ago
old wine glasses engraved
with roses,
rosebuds, and butterflies&mdash;rose
glasses,
as they are called&mdash;could
be bought for
half-a-crown apiece
or less&mdash;dozens of
them; this price has
multiplied nearly
twentyfold. Waterford
cut-glass grows
more and more dear
to buy, from dealers
who know it when
they possess it&mdash;they
will soon be selling
it as if it were antique silver, at so much per ounce&mdash;but
only last year I bought in a provincial town a captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
glass of this ware for 15s., though £8 was the price
asked for one just like it in the West End. Now,
if ever, is the time for a beginner to take up this
line of collecting; old English and Irish glass will
never again be so easy to find at reasonable prices as
it is now.</p>


<h3>SUCH CONNOISSEURSHIP NOT DIFFICULT</h3>

<p>Collecting is a form of education, but it is not difficult
to become a knowledgeable collector of old glass.
Counterfeits are sent out by the thousand, forgeries lie
in wait, totally new glassware, imitative of the old, is on
sale in hundreds of curio dealers’ shops, some of them
otherwise honest and respectable; but only ignorance
or carelessness need be taken in. A little study, a
little observation, a little care, and the beginner will
soon be able to avoid mistakes. Connoisseurship
in old glass is less difficult than it is in old china,
for example; porcelain or earthenware collecting is
more various, more detailed, has reference to longer
periods of manufacture, and involves much more specific
knowledge than glass-collecting does. Yet I have known
two or three collectors of porcelain who declined to
begin collecting old glass because, they said, they would
“never dare”&mdash;as if an almost miraculous skill were
needed to become a connoisseur in old glass! In point
of fact, this is the easiest hobby to study and know;
glass-collecting requires an eye for the different shades
and tints of the metal, a finger-tip for the feel of it, an
ear for the ring of it, and not much money as yet, and
practically that is all. There are no trade-marks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
puzzle or deceive you; there is no such distinction,
difficult to understand and master, as between “soft”
china and “hard.” At present old glass is easy to
know, and not difficult to find.</p>

<p>I propose in this book to <em>give general hints, “tips,”
and instructions applicable to every variety of old glass;
to explain the seven principal tests of genuine age and
antique make; to prepare the beginner to go out collecting
glass with the infallible rules and principles for it fixed in
his mind</em>. Equipped with these, anyone may examine,
test, and if satisfactory buy any vessel of glass which
he or she may find in any odd corner. I am not
writing the book for the rich, but for people with
more taste and cultivation than money, and though I
deprecate “collecting” for the sake of selling again
at a profit, I may well point out that old English and
Irish glass, bought cheaply now, may become an
investment <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de père de famille</i>; the collector may have
the joy of finding it, the continual pleasure of owning
it, and yet know that it will turn out to be “good
business” for his heirs, when the sale comes, at the
end.</p>


<h3>ADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH GLASS</h3>

<p>The collecting of old glass is not yet systematized;
there are no dealers’ catalogues of it or prices current.
For the next few years this advantage will continue in
connexion with old glass. Every dealer knows the
high price which square-marked Worcester china can
command; every second-hand bookseller knows the
price current of first editions, or copies of rare books;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but such is not the case with old glass as yet. Systematization
has hardly begun; there has been little research
into the history of makes and the names of makers.
Here is another advantage for a collector: he may
discover things of that kind at present unknown, and
thus attach his name to the history of old glass which
will some day be written. A local collector may at no
great cost make a donation of his treasures to the local
museum. There is no public collection of Newcastle-made
glass at Newcastle, for instance, or of Sunderland-made
glass at Sunderland, and no local antiquary has
studied the history of the fine glass products made on
the Tyne and the Wear. Nobody knows which kinds
of glass were made at Norwich or Lynn. A history of
Stourbridge glass-making and glassware has yet to be
written. So that research, that additional delight of
collecting, is more open in connexion with glass than
with any other well-known “line.”</p>

<p>The number and diversity of old glass articles may
be indicated by the following incomplete list: wine
glasses, beer glasses, cider glasses, rummers, cordial
glasses, liqueur glasses, tumblers, firing glasses, coaching
glasses, fuddling glasses, beakers, mugs, tankards,
champagne glasses, grog glasses, Masonic glasses,
goblets, Joey glasses, “boot” glasses, “yards of ale,”
toy glasses; flasks, decanters, trays and waiters; punch
or salad bowls, trifle bowls; wine bottles, spirit bottles;
jugs, punch-lifters, decanter stands; jelly glasses,
custard glasses, flip glasses, syllabub glasses; fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
baskets, centre-pieces, sweetmeat glasses, captain
glasses, comports or sweetmeat glass stands, epergnes,
tazzas; salt cellars, sugar castors, pepper boxes;

elaborate baubles and oddities made for ornament
or as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours de force</i>. There seems to have been
a Glass-makers’ Festival held at Newcastle some
hundred years ago, and it was for exhibition then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that most of the freak glass toys and ornaments were
made.</p>

<p>Much old English and Irish glass was contemporaneously
sent to the American market, and the following
articles were advertised as on sale at New York in
the year 1773: “Very Rich Cut Glass Candlesticks,
Cut Glass Sugar
Boxes and
Cream Potts,
Wine, Wine-and-Water
Glasses, and
Beer Glasses,
with Cut
Shanks, Jelly
and Syllabub
Glasses, Glass Salvers, also Cyder Glasses, Orange
and Top Glasses, Glass Cans, Glass Cream Buckets
and Crewets, Royal Arch Mason Glasses, Globe
and Barrel Lamps, etc.” The “etc.” would be
capacious; it would include most of the articles
mentioned in the paragraph just preceding this,
and such things as crystal globes to be filled with
water through which a candle might throw and condense
its rays, for sewing or lace-making purposes,
at night.</p>

<p>A collector ignores window-glass, unless he can come
upon stained glass, purchasing, for £5 perhaps, a leaded
square or oval of sixteenth-century Swiss or German
painted glass, to hang in one of his windows. A collector
ignores plate-glass, except in the form of mirrors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
perhaps. A collector ignores carboys, and also ordinary
bottles, but he acquires when he can one of the thick,
stumpy, almost black glass bottles in which Georgian
people bottled their own claret or port, imported in
the cask. It adds interest to an antique bookcase,
corner cupboard, or cabinet if the panes, or some of
them, show the slight curvature characteristic before
perfectly flat sheet-glass could be cast; and there are
some old panes in which the oxides have turned to a
violet colour&mdash;a silversmith’s shop nearly opposite the
top end of the Haymarket still displays some&mdash;which are
of interest to-day. There used to be glass objects which,
I suppose, we shall never come upon now: the “mortar”
or nightlight-glass, of the kind which stood beside the
last sleep of Charles I, and the “singing-glasses” which
Pepys heard in 1668, when he “had one or two singing-glasses
made, which make an echo to the voice, the
first I ever saw; but so thin, that the very breath
broke one or two of them.” These, and many other
beautiful pieces of old glass, are for ever gone out of
reach.</p>

<p>But the hunter may come upon pieces which came into
existence before Queen Anne died: Jacobean glass, of
the reign of Charles II at latest, is occasionally found.
For a guinea I obtained a fine sacramental vessel in
purfled and wreathed glass bearing the symbol of
the Trinity (see <a href="#comm_vessel">next page</a>); for 5s. a pistol-shaped
scent bottle; and for 12s. 6d. a hand lamp, all three of
Jacobean date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE HUNT FOR IT</h3>

<p>In fact, the limits in glass-collecting are not yet fixable;
you never know what quaint or rare thing you may not
come upon in old glass.
Other lines of collecting
are already systematized,
and part of the systematization
is a limiting of
what you may expect to
find and a raising of what
you may have to pay.
With glass there are no
such boundaries, at present;
anything out of the
ordinary in shape, purpose,
or date, may be
acquired, and should be&mdash;the
uncommon pieces
are the best&mdash;though
often because a piece is
quite unusual, it will be
offered you at a very
low price. The smaller
dealers know that from
half a guinea to a couple
of guineas is what they may charge for an old wine glass,
according to the knobs or the spiral in its stem, but they
do not know any fixed price for less common specimens,
and they will sell at a hundred per cent. profit on the
very small charges they themselves have paid.</p>

<p>Armed with knowledge of the general tests which I
give in the next chapter, a collector may enter a dealer’s
shop near Bond Street or a marine stores in the Old Kent
Road, a broker’s at Hackney or a cabinet-maker’s warehouse
in a country town, a second-hand furniture shop at
Hammersmith or the Caledonian market on a Friday; he
may look into a butler’s pantry, peer into a cupboard in a
kitchen corner, search amidst the dust of a lumber-room,
or reach to the deep interior of a farmhouse dresser or
sideboard; and almost always he will come upon a
collectable bit of old glass. He may hope to come upon
an old crystal gazing-ball, used by fashionable fortune-tellers
a century ago; or even one of the old glass eggs
which eighteenth-century ladies held in their hands to
keep their palms cool for a lover’s kiss.</p>


<h3>THE COLLECTOR’S RANGE</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">

<div class="caption">MASONIC ENGRAVED GOBLET, WITH

</div>

<p>The beginner should recognize from the first that the
range of the collector of old glass is not yet defined;
that the practical hints and rules given in this book may
be applied to <em>any</em> piece of glass, and should be, no matter
how unusual its form or inexplicable now its use in
its time. During the next few years things which now
seem oddities, because they are so unusual, may become
particularly sought after, and valued because they are
rare. I therefore advise the beginner to be a general
and diffusing collector, leaving no genuine old piece
unsnapped-up which comes within his reach and means.
At present cut Waterford glass and spiral-stemmed
blown wine glasses are the things most sought after by
glass collectors, but they may not be so a few years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
hence. I do not mean that they will ever drop in selling
value now, but I anticipate that the selling value of other
glass articles, rather neglected now, may appreciate;
that is why I recommend the practice of general and
diffusive collecting and
a wide range. But if
a collector prefers to
specialize, he may set
out to collect wine
glasses only, or inscribed
glasses only, or what-not
in that way; he may go
in for cut-glass only,
or blown glass only, or
coloured glass only, or
toys and eccentricities
only; he may choose
geographically, collecting
Irish glass only, or
English glass only, or
Bristol glass only, and
so forth. In any case
his range will be limited
by certain dates; he will
very seldom come upon a piece so old as the reign of
Charles II, and he will not care to collect glassware made
so late as the year in which Victoria came to the throne.
With Venice-made glass this book has nothing to do.
Much old Dutch-made glass exists in England, but the
student of this book will be enabled to detect it, and not
unintentionally to acquire it believing it to be English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
made. Bohemian-made glass, cut and coloured, is seldom
taken up by collectors here. The range in these islands is
for English and Irish glass, for it is the ware most readily
collectable, most likely to increase in value, and to be
most readily sold when a collection comes to be dispersed;
I mention this latter consideration because any
collector not wealthy must, in justice to his heirs and
dependents, in this matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> “look to the end.”</p>

<h2><a name="II_SEVEN_GENERAL_GUIDES" id="II_SEVEN_GENERAL_GUIDES"></a>II. SEVEN GENERAL GUIDES
AND TESTS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Setting</span> forth to collect old glassware, therefore,
what general guides may the beginner use,
and what reliable tests can he apply?</p>

<p>There are seven: (1) the <em>tint</em> of the glass; (2) the
<em>sound</em> of the glass; (3) the <em>quality</em> of the glass metal
(or material); (4) the <em>weight</em>; (5) the <em>signs of use and
wear</em>; (6) the <em>pontil-mark</em>; and (7) the <em>workmanship</em>.</p>

<p>These seven suffice to equip the beginner. But as he
collects and gains experience, many details and developments
of them will come to his knowledge, which I shall
refer to in their place.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that there are no maker’s
marks to go by in glass, as there are in porcelain, earthenware,
Sheffield plate, or pewter; and no signatures, as
there are in paintings, drawings, and etchings.</p>


<h3>1. THE TINTS OF OLD GLASS</h3>

<p>Old glass is <em>darkly</em> brilliant. It is not <em>whitely</em> crystal
as modern glass is; the eye can only see what it looks
for, ever, and to uninstructed eyes all glass is merely
glass-colour, but the experienced collector sees that there
are many different tints and tinges in the crystal of glass.
These tints and tinges are the chief guide, test, and
principle by which one judges whether a piece of glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is one of the nineteenth century, eighteenth century,
or seventeenth century, as the case may be.</p>

<p>To judge the tint, place the piece of glass upon a white
tablecloth, near to a tumbler or decanter known to be
modern because of recent
purchase from an ordinary
vendor of household
glass. The eye, looking
for it, will then notice in
the two pieces of glass
a striking difference of
tint, if one of them is
old, that is; the old
piece is not only darker
than the white of the
tablecloth, but darker
than the piece of modern
glass. And <em>the darker (or
sootier) its tint the older
the glass</em>, as a rule. Tint
or tinge is a constant feature
in old glass, and an
obvious feature directly the eye knows what to look
for. Varieties of dark tint may be detected, and by
these varieties the bit of glass may be dated, its period
determined, and its age assigned.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="356" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HUNTING GOBLET, DOME FOOT</div>
</div>

<p>If you place near each other, upon a white damask
cloth, a glass of Charles II date, a William and Mary glass,
a George III glass, and a Victorian glass, you will notice
a darkening and then a whitening in tint (though not a
brightening) as your eye travels from the oldest glass to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the most modern. By “tint” or “tinge” I do not mean
“colour,” in the sense of red or green or blue; I will
deal with coloured glass later on. By “tint” or “tinge”
I mean the shade of leaden, darkish hue in the metal
from which the glass
article was blown or
moulded. This tint or
tinge was inherent in
the molten glass, before
shaping and cooling began.
The metal or raw
material was mixed according
to recipe&mdash;each
glassworks had its own
recipe&mdash;and one of the
materials was lead. The
older the Georgian
glass, the more impure
the metal&mdash;that is, the
fuller of lead oxides&mdash;and
therefore the darker;
what are called improvements
in glass-mixing
have gradually eliminated
the oxides, and therefore the leaden tint or tinge
also; it is astonishing how many different shades and
tinges of darkness (in that sense) a cabinet of old glass
can show. In a few glasses the bowl is pale sapphire
or aquamarine colour, the stem being the tint of plain
glass.</p>

<p>The glass collector exercises his sight and applies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
test; it enables him to detect a counterfeit, though in
shape and general appearance it imitates the genuine
antique; it is too whitely crystal, too tintless to be old.
Curio-shop windows at Brighton, for instance, are full of
frauds in glass, chiefly cut-glass, or glass moulded to resemble
cut-glass; but the chalky-white tint betrays and
condemns them, and the instructed collector will not be
taken in. Also he will recognize genuine Waterford
glass by its own tinge of colour, and genuine Cork glass
in a similar way; he will see that old Dutch-made glass,
when thick, has a smeary, milk-and-watery tint, and when
thin has a flashy, meretricious absence of deep tinting:
he will learn that old Stourbridge glass was whiter than
antique Bristol or Newcastle glass, and sometimes was
milky-white; in course of time and practice he will come
to be able to “date” and “place” a piece of old glass
at sight, as well as instantly to reject a fraud.</p>

<p><em>The tints of Irish-made glass.</em> Glass made at Waterford,
late in the eighteenth century and early in the
nineteenth, was a fine product, often exquisitely cut:
it is distinguishable in more than one way, but has a
characteristic tinge which, once seen, is unmistakable.
I cannot find exact words for it, it is not a blue nor a
green nor a blackish tint, but is something of all three,
and was due to excessive presence of oxide of lead.
Nobody has done any research as to Irish-made glass,
and people suppose that Cork-made glass resembled the
Waterford glass, but that is very unlikely, because each
factory mixed according to its own recipe, and also used
a different variety of each of the raw materials common
to all glass. In point of fact, Cork glass is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> “duller”
than Waterford, and it has quite a different, a pale,
almost dun or yellowish, tinge, particularly visible in
the thicker parts; a good many lustre-ornaments seem
to have been made at Cork. Belfast glass was yellowish,
too, if we may judge by the tint of Williamite glasses.</p>


<h3>2. THE SOUND OF OLD GLASS</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 292px;">

<div class="caption">EXAMPLE OF FINE QUALITY

SPIRAL. NOTE THE
ROSE LEAVES AND STEMS</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps because more lead was used in the “metal” or
raw material, but at any rate for some distinctive reason,
<em>old English and Irish-made glass
has a more musical sound than any
made abroad</em>. Flick or flip with
your finger-nail, or pinch near
your ear, a piece of this old
ware, and <em>a vibrant, resonant, and
lingering ring is audible</em>. The
thinner the part of the glass you
flick the more the sound, of
course; but something of a ring
should come from almost any
part of the article. Another way
of producing this characteristic
sound is to keep on rubbing a
wetted finger around the edge
of the bowl of a wine glass or
finger bowl, till rhythmic vibration
is set up, and the sound
steals forth. And it is a <em>bell-like, musical note</em>, almost
the F sharp or G sharp, or A or B of the 4th octave
in a pianoforte keyboard: darkish glass with this
resonance is almost sure to be old English or Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
made. Much eighteenth-century Dutch glass is still
extant here, and is often mistaken for English; but it
need not be: thin or thick, <em>Dutch glass sends out no
lingering resonance</em>, long, clear, musical, and true. <em>Dutch
glass tinkles</em> when you flip it, but the sound is dead a
few seconds after being born. The sound test for old
English or Irish glass is, Does it ring with a musical note
that throbs, sings, and lingers in a way to delight the
ear? <em>The sound of old Dutch, French, Italian, or German
glass is cracked, so to speak</em>, though the vessel itself is
not; but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And thinner, clearer, farther going!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are lines which Tennyson might have written to describe
the music of old English and Irish glass; too much stress
cannot be laid upon this test&mdash;the <em>lasting</em> note is the
criterion.</p>

<p>So that now, with both tint and sound to guide us,
we need not be taken in by modern copies or old Dutch
glass.</p>


<h3>3. THE QUALITY OF OLD GLASS METAL</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 308px;">
<a name="quality" id="quality"></a><img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="308" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">EXAMPLE OF FINE QUALITY;
SHOWING THE BUTTERFLY
AND THE COTTON-WHITE
WREATHING AROUND THE
CENTRAL TUBE</div>
</div>

<p>Italians and Frenchmen came to England in the
sixteenth century to teach the art and mystery of glass-making
to our islanders; yet neither old Italian nor
French glass metal has the <em>quality</em> of old English and
Irish glass metal. The glassware made here between
the reigns of Queen Anne and Queen Victoria had the
best <em>quality</em> of any glass ever made in the world. But
what is <em>quality</em> in this connexion? It means material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but it also means the manipulation of material and the
effect produced. The glass made during the reigns of
the four Georges was called “flint glass” and “lead
glass”&mdash;misnomers, perhaps, but I need not take up
space here in discussing that;
the important point is that the
<em>quality</em> of the metal and the skill
of the manipulation resulted in
thinness, rigidity, shapeliness,
a velvety surface, dark sheen,
brilliancy, radiancy of facets
when cut, and the vibrant,
musical ring of the eighteenth-century
glass. Glass made
under Charles II was not so
dark, and Victorian glass was
whiter; Victorian and modern
English glass is of excellent
quality, but is uniform to almost
a painful degree. It lacks character
and diversity; the Georgian
glass was individual and
original, so to speak. There
were faults in it&mdash;little air-blobs, or vesicles, that feel like
pimples on the surface, or show as bubbles within it;
striations, like lines of fibre, also; and deviations from
the strict mathematic line or curve, which were due to
hand-work. But if you examine contemporary Dutch-made,
French-made, or Italian-made glass, you notice
that the same defects exist, and more numerously,
while there is a flimsiness, or a lumpiness, or a smeary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
look and harsh feel which are absent from old English
and Irish glass.</p>

<p>A specked, pimply surface, and a dull thickness and
clumsy lumpiness or flashy thin lightness, are found in
old Dutch-made glass; and this, taken in conjunction
with the absence of true ring, enables a collector to
reject the old ware sent over from Holland. <em>The quality
of the English and Irish glass metal comes out in the surface</em>,
too, a little; the fingers feel the surface of an old blown
wine glass to be <em>cool</em>, <em>smooth</em>, <em>hard</em>, <em>and yet velvety</em>;
while the surface of Waterford cut-glass has a <em>silky feel</em>.</p>


<h3>4. THE WEIGHT OF OLD GLASS</h3>

<p>In his privately circulated book on “English Baluster
Stemmed Glasses of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries”
Mr. Francis Buckley aptly says that “English-made
glasses of the first period were all light in weight and
cloudy in appearance. Some time between the Restoration
and the end of the seventeenth century, but when
precisely it is difficult to say, the English glass-makers
began to try experiments with a view to removing from
their glasses this dull and cloudy appearance. Their
object was to produce a substance like crystal; and this
object they eventually achieved by introducing into their
metal a large quantity of lead.” This gave the characteristic
weight.</p>

<p>The old Dutch glass seems light in weight, even when
it is thick; <em>old English and Irish glass seems relatively heavy</em>
even when it is thin. <em>Waterford glass is especially heavy.</em>
These differences in weight are probably due to differences
in the materials used for mixing the metal; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
whatever the cause, they aid the collector to know the
real from the counterfeit, and the old English from the
Dutch. Even the thick, clumsy glasses made here in
the reign of William and Mary seem more weighty than
those otherwise exactly similar which were then brought
over from Holland.</p>


<h3>5. THE SIGNS OF USE AND WEAR</h3>

<p>Many fantastic pieces of old glass were made as
curiosities or ornaments, but most old glass was made
for use. Glass is easily scratched; as the wine glasses
and decanters were set down upon the hard, polished
mahogany of dinner-tables, after the cloth was drawn, and
were moved, the feet of the wine glasses and the bases of
the decanters become scratched thereby. Lustre-ornaments,
glass candlesticks, or glass vases which stood upon
marble or hard wood mantelpieces, being moved when
maidservants were dusting, became scratched at the base.
The collector will therefore carefully examine those
parts of a piece of glass which, if it is old, may be expected
to show the signs of use and wear caused by
contact and movement upon hard surfaces; it is well to
do this by the aid of a pocket-lens&mdash;which ought to be a
glass collector’s constant companion.</p>

<p><em>In a genuine old piece the scratches are numerous, do not
all run the same way, and are dust-coloured, more or less.</em>
Most counterfeits show no scratches at all, but <em>the more
elaborate forgeries show artificial scratches; these usually
run all one way, however, or seem all to have been made
together at the same time, and sometimes these artificial
scratchings appear in parts of the glass which would not be</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<em>exposed to marking of the kind when in use</em>, as, for instance,
inside the bowls.</p>

<p>Yet it is not wise to condemn and refuse as a fraud
a piece of glass which shows the other four or five
general evidences of genuineness simply because only
slight scratching is evident; for the glass may have been
standing in a cupboard unused for many years, its nose
put out of joint by some change of fashion in table-ware
soon after it had been bought, and have passed into a
collector’s cabinet before coming into your hands for
examination. Nor is it safe to suppose that the more
the scratches the older the piece; it may have had more
than the common amount of usage. If the glass has
a “folded foot” or a “ring-base” to stand on, the
scratches will be at the very edge of the foot, or on the
ring, just where it touched the table or mantelpiece,
and there only.</p>


<h3>6. THE PONTIL-MARK</h3>

<p>I mention this last because it does not apply to all old
glass; it does not apply to glass that was cast or moulded,
but it applies to all old blown glass, and is a very important
test and guide indeed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="300" height="312" alt="" />
<div class="caption">UNDER-SIDE OF WINE GLASS FOOT, SHOWING
THE PONTIL-MARK AND THE
HEMMED OR “FOLDED FOOT” EDGE</div>
</div>

<p>The pontil-mark is either a depression in the glass,
shallow, about the size of the third finger-end, or a lump
about that size, standing up from the level of the glass
around it. The pontil-mark indicates <em>first</em> that the piece
of glass was originally blown, and <em>second</em> that before
removing the blow-pipe the workman, as usual, attached
the blown glass to a pontil. The pontil or punt is an
iron rod, joined to the vessel by a little melted glass while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the vessel is still hot. When the time comes for taking
away the pontil, it is done by contact with cold water,
which causes the glass to contract around the pontil-end
and the pontil to become detached. Glass vessels which
were blown, only,
show the depression
or the lump accordingly:
blown-glass
vessels which were
afterwards “cut”
show it in part only,
or not at all, if the
glass-cutter removed
it: vessels neither
blown nor cut, but
cast in a mould, do
not show it because
they never had it.
In the eighteenth
century and the first quarter of the nineteenth, glass
moulding seldom took place; <em>so that the presence of the
pontil-mark, whether it be a hollow or a lump, usually
indicates age in the vessel which shows it</em>.</p>

<p>In the oldest glass the pontil-hole is flaked with something
which rather resembles mica. In the oldest wine
glasses the pontil-lump stands out knobbily. In every
case there are signs of the local fracture. As a rule,
the older the glass the bigger and rougher the pontil-mark.</p>

<h3>7. THE WORKMANSHIP</h3>

<p>The sensible, practical adaptation to purpose and the
workmanlike make of English and Irish old glass afford
another test; compared with our native product, French
glass of the same period seems meagre, and Dutch
flimsy or clumsy; Italian is fantastic and tawdry. The
French and the Italian ware was often gilded, the Dutch
painted: these are features seldom seen on English and
Irish glass. In place of gilding or other added external
decoration the island ware presented a substance neither
too thin nor too thick, bowls perfectly rounded, stems
strong and stout but not bulky, too tall, or too short;
feet that hold on to the table well, and are not warped
and uneven. In the freak and toy pieces, too, the
excellence of the workmanship is obvious.</p>

<h2><a name="III_BLOWN_WARE" id="III_BLOWN_WARE"></a>III. BLOWN WARE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> blow-pipe is not so old an implement as
the potter’s wheel, but it seems to have been
used 5000 years ago, in Egypt. Pliny first
gave the fanciful account of Ph&#339;nician mariners accidentally
fusing carbonate of soda with sea-sand; Dr.
Johnson commented on that as follows: “Who, when he
saw the first sand or ashes by a casual intenseness of heat
melted into a metallic form, rugged with excrescences,
and clouded with impurities, would have imagined that
in this shapeless lump lay concealed so many conveniences
of life as would in time constitute a great part of
the happiness of the world? Yet by some such fortuitous
liquefaction was mankind taught to procure a body
at once in a high degree solid and transparent; which
might admit the light of the sun and exclude the violence
of the wind; which might extend the view of the philosopher
to new ranges of existence, supply the decays
of nature, and succour old age with subsidiary
sight.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the first glassware was cast, or moulded,
and there is no record of when or where the blow-pipe
was first used. Ancient glass beads were probably
made by moulding: probably the first glass ever made
in England (the windows at Wearmouth Church, in
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 675) was cast. Not until the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
apparently, was any blown glass made in England, and
none of it remains both extant and intact; collectors are
fortunate who come upon a piece of date so early as the
first half of the seventeenth century, even; but from the
last few years of the seventeenth century to the first few
years of the nineteenth century inclusive, English and
Irish blown glass was the best in the world. Therefore
it is the <em>blown</em> pieces which are the most characteristic,
whether blown only or blown and afterwards engraved
or cut. And the blown pieces, being intended for use,
are the more numerous, and the more readily collected;
the cut and engraved pieces, being for ornament, were
more costly, and therefore fewer&mdash;though perhaps they
have been more carefully preserved.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_CUT_MOULDED_AND" id="IV_CUT_MOULDED_AND"></a>IV. CUT, MOULDED, AND
ENGRAVED WARE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">A collector</span> nervous about frauds should take
note that <em>counterfeits of old cut-glass are much
more numerous than counterfeits of old blown
glass</em>; the latter is forged, in the shape of wine glasses
with spiral stems, but not at all successfully. In cut-glass
there is also the confusion with moulded glass to beware
of, but the finger feels the edges of cut-glass to be slightly
rough&mdash;rather like woodwork edges not sand-papered off&mdash;and
the eye can detect a difference between what was
cut and what was moulded. In fine old cut-glass the
surface feels silky, and the touch slips upon it where the
cutting is shallow; moulded glass has a wavy, rounded
feel. Cut-ware glass seems to be the more popular
“line” of collecting in glass, so it is well to consider
the kinds of cutting here; remembering all the while
the tests of tint, etc., as between the old and the new.</p>


<h3>THE ORIGIN OF CUT-GLASS</h3>

<p>English-and Irish-made glass, being heavier and better
quality than any other, lent itself to cutting especially
well; but probably the chief cause of the development
of cut-glass here was the excise duty, which was levied
on the plain manufactured article, so to speak&mdash;the
glassware as the blower or moulder turned it out. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
excise on that having been paid, all additional value given
to the ware afterwards was non-taxable; therefore cutting
came into vogue, and the glass cut in these islands became
the best in the world. Of all cut-glass “Waterford”
was the most beautiful; its specific gravity was the
greatest, and deep cutting could take place without the
ware being clumsily heavy to begin with.</p>


<h3>THE “WATERFORD” STYLE OF CUTTING</h3>

<p>Cork, Dublin, and Belfast cut-glass resembles Waterford
cut-glass in everything but tint and weight, and
perhaps it was the Celtic strain in the Irish glass-cutters’
blood which gave a more than English freedom and
fantasy to their art. At any rate, the style of their cutting
may be described as “curved” and “arabesque”;
it was also shallow, generally; flowing lines and slight
hollows, flattish rounded curves, and interlacings
are evident; stems and candlesticks are “whittled”
rather than cut deeply; rims are often surrounded by
little semicircles, the edge of each semicircle being cut
into angles with sharp points; sometimes these resemble
half-open fans. The less the amount of cut ornament,
the earlier the piece, as a rule. There is English style
diamond-shaped cutting in Irish glass, and some “hob-nail”
cutting&mdash;shaped flat ends standing out as hob-nails
do from boot soles: there is some “strawberry”
cutting; but as a rule, a fluent, curving, arabesquing
style of cutting, with parallel horizontal lines, hollow
prisms, upright fluting, and parallel vertical lines in
panels, the latter sometimes resembling basket-plaiting,
characterize Waterford cut-glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE “STOURBRIDGE” CUTTING</h3>

<p>The Stourbridge glass-cutters, on the other hand,
rather over-did and abused the deep, regular, machine-like
repetition of the “diamond” and the “hob-nail”
and the “pomegranate.” Sometimes, however, the
cutting was flat and flowing, and a festoon-like, hung-tapestry-like
form may be seen.</p>

<div class="caption">(1 AND 2) WATERFORD, AND (3) STOURBRIDGE CUT-GLASS BOWLS</div>
</div>


<h3>THE “BRISTOL” CUTTING</h3>

<p>Bristol glass-cutters went in for depth, but also for
fantasy: a leaflike arrangement may be seen: the flowing
lines in “Bristol” cutting are not so fine and curved as
they are in Waterford glass.</p>


<h3>“NEWCASTLE” CUTTING</h3>

<p>Perhaps the “thistle” glasses, so popular in Scotland,
were made and cut at Newcastle, the nearest glass-making
centre: but “thistle cutting” does not mean
cut like a thistle; it means minute diamond-shape cuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
upon a vessel conventionally resembling a thistle-head
in shape.</p>


<h3>THE STAR AT THE BASE</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="300" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">EXAMPLE OF “POMEGRANATE” AND “DIAMOND”
CUTTING: NOTE THE “STAR” ALSO, CUT TO
THE EDGE, AND THE SCRATCH ACROSS THE
BASE CAUSED BY WEAR</div>
</div>

<p>In old cut-glass a star is often found, cut in the base
of the vessel, <em>under</em> it; usually the old glass-cutters
extended this
star to the very
edges of the
base. In more
modern cutting
the rays of the
star do not extend
so far.</p>


<h3>MOULDED
GLASS</h3>

<p>About 1850
moulded imitations
of cut-glass
begun to
oust the more
expensive originals,
and moulded glass of that date and since then
is not worth a collector’s attention. But <em>old</em> moulded
glass, with the right tint in it, is worth acquiring; in
the shape of candlesticks, for instance.</p>

<p>Cutting could be done, and was done, either upon
glassware originally blown, or upon glass originally
moulded&mdash;that is, cast in a mould. Sometimes the
stem or shank and foot were left untouched while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
upper part of the vessel was cut. Moulded glass uncut
shows no acuteness of edge nor sharpness in the depressions.
Modern moulded glass is often very elaborate,
however, and the beginner may readily be deceived.</p>


<h3>ENGRAVED GLASS</h3>

<p>Some part of the engraving on some glasses was really
cutting: in roses which form part of the decoration
of finely engraved
glasses, the finger
feels plane after
plane of depression,
where the engraver
deeply cut away the
metal to imitate the
petals of the rose.
When the engraving
goes as deep as this,
or deeper than usual,
the effect is to give
a dust colour to the
engraved work, which helps one to be sure that the
object before one is not an old plain glass recently
“engraved up” with a Jacobite or other design to make
it sell for more money.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="300" height="279" alt="" />
<div class="caption">UNDER-SIDE OF BASIN, SHOWING THE
STAR CUT TO THE EDGE</div>
</div>

<p>But as a rule engraving is a surface operation, done
with a diamond or on the wheel, or by sandblast, or
by use of acids. Where the engraving is flat, not cut
in, the original greyish-white effect may long remain;
a collector need not suppose that the engraving is recent
because the tint of it is not brownish, a colour due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
years and accumulations of dust. Indeed, the rougher
and coarser the recent engraving the more likely dust to
settle <em>in</em> it, as well as upon it, and to give it a dusty tint.
Really fine old engraving can remain almost as fresh in
appearance and tint as it ever was, even till to-day.
<em>And the natural tint of glass engraving resembles the tint of
ground glass.</em> Of course, when the polishing-wheel was
applied, either to parts or to the whole of the engraving,
this greyish-white tint was polished away.</p>

<p>The polishing-wheel was also used to remove the
pontil-mark (when it was a lump or knob) from the feet
of wine and other glasses.</p>

<p>Dutch or German engraved old glass shows more
<em>smeary</em> in the engraved part than English or Irish glassware
does.</p>

<h2><a name="V_OLD_COLOURED_GLASS" id="V_OLD_COLOURED_GLASS"></a>V. OLD COLOURED GLASS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> Bristol, Nailsea, Wrockwardine, and perhaps
at Norwich, glassware of various colours
was made. There are collectors who care for
nothing else but coloured glass; there are collectors who
only care for coloured glass paper-weights; there are
collectors who will not buy coloured glass at all.</p>


<h3>“BRISTOL”</h3>

<p>Bristol coloured glass is the most sought for. There
are several varieties. The rarest is the opaque, whitish
glass which rather resembles porcelain or Battersea
enamel in general tint, and is painted upon as if it were
porcelain or enamel: held to a good light this ware is
seen to be rather opalescent, and might be dubbed opal
glass. Edkins, a painter of Bristol delft, used delft-like
colours and designs on this opal glass; wreaths of
flowers (the rose and the fuchsia in particular) and
flourishes in the Louis XV style are characteristic.
Cups and saucers, teapots, tumblers, bowls and jugs,
cruet vessels, and candlesticks of this ware exist, though
few; the last-named imitated Battersea enamel candlesticks
in shape and decoration. A characteristic of this
glass is ridges or waves on the surface, detected by the
finger. The earliest examples have domed and folded
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Less rare, but rare, are the wine glasses with red and
white or blue and white spirals in the stems which were
made at Bristol; if the white is not cotton-white but
greyish, however, such a glass is probably old Dutch.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption">BRISTOL COLOURED GLASS PEPPER
BOX, SHOWING THE ELABORATE
FLOWERS, SUCH AS ARE SEEN IN
PAPER-WEIGHTS</div>
</div>

<p>Fine tableware of transparent
blue, blue-green,
red, and purple was made
at Bristol; the blue is
a peculiar, unique blue,
imitated but never well
reproduced; where the
glass is thick, it, held to
the light, shows a Royal
purple, and where thin
it is almost a sea-blue.
Egg-cups of this ware are
handsome. Bristol red
glass is of a ruby hue,
with not so much vermilion
in it as in Bohemian
glass: there is
also “cherry-red” glass.
Bristol blue and red glass
was sometimes touched with gilt, in lettering and lines;
this did not wear well except when embossed.</p>

<p>Bristol produced the finest glass paper-weights&mdash;of
a size and shape to fill the palm of one’s hand if only the
wrist and finger-tips are touching the paper&mdash;and at the
base of these you see flowers of coloured glass, bright and
various in hue, and rendered with wonderful skill; of
the same kind of mosaic or tessellated glass is a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pepper pot in my possession, a very rare example.
Other Bristol paper-weights, larger, and door-stops,
still larger and heavier, were tall ovals, two or three or
four times the size of a goose’s egg and rather resembling
one in shape; the colour is a verdant or a sage green, and
the inner decoration is flower-petals and leaves, pearled
over as if by dew, and blown with extraordinary skill.</p>

<div class="caption">BRISTOL COLOURED PAPER-WEIGHTS

</div>

<p>Collectors should beware of forgeries of parti-coloured
paper-weights. They may be known by the coarseness
of the flowers inside the glass, the lack of fine workmanship,
and the tawdriness of the colours.</p>


<h3>“BRISTOL” AND “NAILSEA”</h3>

<p>Nailsea is a small place near Bristol, and nobody can
now be sure from which of the two came any particular
bauble&mdash;coloured glass-flask, pestle, bell, witch-ball,
tobacco pipe, trumpet, jug, rolling-pin, bellows-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
article, walking-stick or rapier, or the (excessively rare)
long glass cylinders containing coloured glass counters
for games. But it is thought that the Bristol wares of
this kind were brighter in colour than the Nailsea product,
which, because less skilful and daring, perhaps,
was cooler in tint, less striking in mixture of colours,
and therefore more refined. Probably Bristol produced
the glass which is ornamented by alternate broad stripes
of red and opal-white. Perhaps Nailsea was responsible
for glass of a “greenery-yallery” hue containing whitish
spots or splashes: there are many forgeries of jugs and
rolling-pins, in this style, about.</p>


<h3>“WROCKWARDINE”</h3>

<p>At Wrockwardine, in Salop, the glass works turned out
coloured walking-sticks, ewers, scent-bottles, flasks,
twin bottles for oil and vinegar, and toys; the characteristic
being that the glass is <em>striped</em>, in white and one or
more colours.</p>


<h3>“SUNDERLAND”</h3>

<p>The Sunderland glassworks are supposed to have
made rolling-pins, and almost certainly produced the
curious polygonal salt cellars (which some people have
thought to be insulators for piano-feet), that reflect
colour and gilding or coloured heads of men or women,
from their bases, talc keeping the ornament there in
place.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEA</h3>

<p>Witch-balls seem to have been made at Bristol, for
I own one of the Bristol red and opal-white; at Nailsea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
(in inferior, watery blue); and at Wrockwardine
(greenish-blue striped with pale white). These balls,
it is said, were hung at each door and window, “to keep
the witches out” (see <a href="#witchballs">illustration</a>, page 8).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="600" height="287" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SUNDERLAND SALT CELLARS</div>
</div>

<p>Glass articles splashed with colour <em>outside</em>, on the
exterior of the article, exist, but in great rarity; the
splashed-on colours are glass-oxides, but look like oil-paint;
the greenish clear glass beneath the splashing
resembles the Nailsea product.</p>


<h3>GREEN, PURPLE, AND YELLOW WINE GLASSES</h3>

<p>Fine wine glasses, for hock or other white wines, were
made in olive-green, grass-green, purple, and orange;
these are collected by some people for use at table, by
some for the collector’s cabinet. The older ones show
the characteristics of dimensions and shape which will
be described later in this book.</p>

BALUSTER STEM</div>
</div>

<p>Seeking as I do right through
this book to state general rules
and tests which the beginner
may apply to all glass he comes
across, I now mention <em>the
general features of old drinking
glasses</em>.</p>


<h3>THE LUMPY STEM</h3>

<p>In days when men did not
rise from the dinner-table quite
so easily as they fell under it, the stem of a drinking
glass must be thick, lest it snap in the convulsive hand,
and was more safely held when it was also lumpy or
bulbous&mdash;“knopped” and “baluster”-like are other
terms for it: the fingers clung to the knobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE STOUT STEM</h3>

<p>Even when the bulbous or lumpy stem ceased to be the
rule, a <em>thick</em> stem&mdash;three or four times the thickness of
modern wine-glass stems&mdash;was the rule, for the reason
just given.</p>

<img src="images/i_041a.jpg" width="280" height="493" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TALL GOBLET, AIR-SPIRAL AND
DOME-FOOT</div>
</div>


<h3>THE EXTENSIVE FOOT</h3>

<p>Similarly, old drinking glasses were always made with
very broad “feet” or bases; usually the foot had a
larger circumference than the bowl. A semi-drunken
hand, setting the vessel down on the table, might leave
it rocking for two or three seconds, but the foot was so
broad that it could hardly rock over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE RAISED FOOT</h3>

<p>Because of the pontil-mark being often a knob, or
protuberance, the foot of the glass must not wholly rest
upon the table, but touch it near the circumference
of the foot only, lest the knob at the end of the stem
should prevent the glass standing level, or should scratch
the mahogany.</p>


<h3>THE DOMED FOOT</h3>

<p>Some of the oldest glasses, in which the pontil-mark
is quite a large protuberance, stand upon feet which,
flat upon the table at and near the edge, rise domelike
in the centre. These dome feet are seldom symmetrical;
made by hand, the flat part is usually wider on one side
of the dome than on the other.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="262" height="171" alt="" />
<div class="caption">DOME-FOOT</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/i_042a.jpg" width="262" height="171" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HIGH INSTEP FOOT (TWO VARIETIES)</div>
</div>


<h3>THE HIGH INSTEP FOOT</h3>

<p>As the pontil-mark became smaller and not so rough,
the dome foot gave place to one which is mainly flat at
the base but slightly conical, rising like a low round
hillock, to join the stem: seen in profile, these somewhat
resemble a leg and a foot with a high instep. No
seventeenth-or eighteenth-century stemmed drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
glass except a “firing” glass has a foot with an uniformly
flat section.</p>


<h3>THE HEMMED OR FOLDED FOOT</h3>

<p>Many old wine glasses are chipped at the edge of the
foot; this was due to carelessness in the scullery sometimes,
but often to careless use by convivial guests.
Therefore glass-makers learned the advantage of folding
the edge of the foot under, like a hem in needlework;
a rounded edge, less likely to be chipped, was thus
obtained. This “hem” is nearly always irregular,
being turned in more at one part of the base than
another. As a rule, the presence of a folded foot
indicates that the glass was made
before 1760.</p>


<h3>THE “NORWICH” FOOT</h3>

<p>Nobody knows what kind of
glasses were made at Norwich
or Lynn, but there is a supposition that horizontal lines,
in the bowl or in the foot, mean “Norwich-made”: the
foot is slightly terraced, so to speak.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="300" height="169" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“NORWICH” FOOT</div>
</div>


<h3>THE FIRING GLASS FOOT</h3>

<p>There is, I believe, in certain Lodges, a semi-ritual
practice of hammering on the table with the feet of
glasses, rhythmically, after a toast, somewhat in the style
of applause called “Kentish fire.” This seems never
to have been done with wine glasses, but old cordial or
spirit glasses exist in considerable numbers which were
expressly made for the purpose, and furnished with flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
feet an eighth of an inch thick or more, so that they
should not crack by concussion; in these old “firing-glasses,”
too, the foot is
bigger in circumference
than the bowl.</p>


<h3>GENERAL RULES</h3>

<p>These considerations
apply to stemmed glasses
for ale, beer, cider, and
cordials also; and to
rummers and grog glasses
upon stems that are short
but stout. Therefore a
<em>genuine English or Irish
drinking glass of seventeenth-,
eighteenth-, or
early nineteenth-century
make has, in addition to the tint, ring, quality, pontil-mark,
workmanship, and signs of use, a stout stem and
an extensive, raised foot</em>.</p>

<div class="caption">MASONIC FIRING GLASS: NOTE THE
THICK FOOT</div>
</div>

<p>About 1830, the six-bottle men being all dead, and
even the three-bottle men becoming rare, the thickness
of the stem and the extensiveness of the foot could
safely be reduced; the pontil-mark, too, was smaller,
and the foot of a glass could be made with a lower instep,
so to speak. Therefore a <em>thin stem and a foot not
bigger, or smaller, than the top of the bowl, with no pontil-mark,
or hardly any, signify that the glass was made during
Victoria’s reign or just before it began</em>.</p>

<h3>“THUMB” GLASSES</h3>

<p>“Thumb” glasses are those in which the external
surface of the bowl is pitted with depressions the size
of a finger-end, so that the shaking hand of the bibulous
might be the less likely to let the glass drop. They are
usually tall of bowl and short of stem, but rather big of
foot.</p>


<h3>THE SQUARE FOOT</h3>

<p>Old glasses with thick square bases appear to belong
to the end of the eighteenth century, when the “Empire”
style was influencing manufacture: often the
base is of inferior workmanship to the bowl.</p>


<h3>THE FEET OF TUMBLERS</h3>

<p>Even the bases of tumblers were made thick, though
they were smaller in circumference than the top of the
tumbler.</p>

<h2><a name="VII_THE_VARIOUS_TYPES_OF" id="VII_THE_VARIOUS_TYPES_OF"></a>VII. THE VARIOUS TYPES OF
STEM</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Wine</span> glasses and other drinking vessels of
glass may best be classified according to
the shape or decoration of the stem.</p>


<h3>1. THE BALUSTER STEM</h3>

<p>The oldest English drinking glasses are those which
have lumpy, knobby, bulbous stems, of wavy outlines
imitating the stems of Tudor and Stuart silver goblets,
and rather resembling the shape of balusters in stair or
terrace balustrades, or the uprights in some old gate-leg
tables; perhaps among the baluster stems we should class
those which rather resemble an inverted obelisk, the
broad part just under the bowl and the point within
the foot (see <a href="#comport">illustration</a>, page 84); this long remained
the favourite shape (and is almost the characteristic
shape) for what are called sweetmeat glasses on stems,
and for comports or glass stands for sweetmeat glasses;
it gives a kind of shoulder to the stem. Sometimes the
lower part of such a stem as this is square in section.</p>


<h3>THE COLLAR IN THE BALUSTER STEM</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="williamite" id="williamite"></a><img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="200" height="424" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“WILLIAMITE” GLASS:
NOTE THE “COLLAR”
ON THE BALUSTER
STEM</div>
</div>

<p>Often the stem does not directly join the bottom of the
bowl, but has a “neck,” with an outstanding ring of
glass or “collar” around the neck; sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
collar is double or triple; the neck and collar were often
used later, in other than baluster stems. Sometimes
the collar is near the foot; sometimes there are two
collars. Around some stems a
fillet is found; these are very
rare.</p>


<h3>THE OLDER BALUSTERS</h3>

<p><em>The stouter and lumpier the older
the baluster stem</em>, as a rule; after
the accession of William and
Mary, the baluster stems grew
more and more refined and less
heavy as the years went on. But
baluster-stem glasses are prized by
most collectors according to their
bigness and lumpiness of outline;
the older the better, from this point
of view. The massive stems are
very handsome; where they touch
the bowl the bowl is very thick, and because the stem
and pontil-mark were big, the foot is often domed;
so that the curves of the bowl, the undulations of the
stem, and the domelike or high-instep-like curve of the
foot make a matched and pleasant outline for the whole.
<em>Almost invariably baluster-stem glasses have folded feet.</em></p>


<h3>COINS IN THE BALUSTER STEMS</h3>

<p>Two things may be looked for inside these stems&mdash;coins
and “tears.” Sometimes one of the swelling-out
parts of the baluster stem was large enough to enclose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a small silver coin; a coin glass is exceedingly rare and
correspondingly valuable, but the date of the coin does
not necessarily indicate the date of the glass.</p>


<h3>“TEARS” IN THE STEM</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 238px;">
<a name="largeale" id="largeale"></a><img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="238" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PLAIN DRAWN LARGE ALE
GLASS, SHOWING “TEAR”
IN STEM</div>
</div>

<p>Many baluster stems enclose a separate blob or
bubble of glass, called a “tear.” It has been thought
that this was an accidental feature,
due to imperfect mixing
of the metal and the presence
of air in the molten glass.
Obviously, that is an unlikely
cause, and in the Diary of
Mr. Pepys I have discovered
a passage which seems to
show how these “tears” in
the stem would begin. Writing
little more than twenty
years before 1689, Pepys refers
to the “chymical glasses
which break all to dust by
breaking off a little end;
which is a great mystery to
me.” These were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacrymæ Batavicæ</i>, or
“Dutch tears,” and were made by letting drops of
molten glass fall into water; hissing, the glass became
tearlike in shape, a blob with a long slender tail, and
hollow. Probably such as these were the “tears” which
appear as ornaments within the old drinking-glass stems,
distinctly visible and separate from the rest of the glass in
the stem, though of the same tinge and quality of material.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The name “tear” is to this extent a misnomer, that
nearly always the “tear” is bigger at the top than the
bottom; whereas a tear proper swells out more the
lower it slips on the cheek. But I own a baluster-stem
glass in which the lower part of the “tear” is the bigger,
and in some such glasses the “tear” swells out or in
to match the shape of the stem. Sometimes three or
five or more very small “tears”
appear in one of the bulbs.</p>


<h3>2. THE DRAWN-OUT OR PLAIN
ROUND STEM</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 199px;">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="199" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">DRAWN BOWL AND PLAIN
ROUND STEM</div>
</div>

<p>“Drawn glasses” were made
at twice&mdash;the bowl and the stem
in one, the foot added later. To
understand better this meaning
of the word “drawn,” imagine
a soap-bubble with the extra suds
adhering to one part of it, and
suppose that the extra suds could
be drawn out to make a stem; that
was the method used in glass. The
plain, round stem resembles a solid cylinder, but it is
part of the bowl, in fact it is a continuation of the bowl.
The end of the cylinder, around which the foot was
welded, made a pontil-lump, and therefore the plain
stem glass has either a high instep or a dome foot.</p>

<p>The plain round stems were made stout because of
insobriety, though that had begun to lessen when this
second type of stem came into vogue. “Tears” are
often seen in the plain round stems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. THE CORRUGATED ROUND STEM</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="371" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">(1) CORRUGATED STEM AND (2) HOP AND
BARLEY GLASSES, THE LATTER SHOWING
THE “SILVER SPIRAL”</div>
</div>

<p>Stems which are ornamented by outside spirals, or
series of small ridges and grooves alternating, are usually
old Dutch; but some of them are English, though of
inferior quality and ring. The quality is so poor and
the make so unsatisfactory
that
probably they were
a “cheap and
nasty” contemporary
imitation
and substitute for
glasses adorned
with the air spiral,
the type which
succeed the plain
round stem. It is
hardly likely that
the corrugated
stem preceded the
air-spiral stem;
or, if at all, for more than a few years. With these
corrugated stems one expects to find, almost without
exception, that the bowl of the glass is shaped like an
inverted, incurving, waisted bell.</p>


<h3>4. THE AIR-SPIRAL STEM</h3>

<p>At any rate, out of the “tears” in the baluster and
plain round stems was developed the idea of ornamenting
stems by internal spirals or twists, and whether these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
should be number four or number three in the chronological
order is not very important. By twisting while
drawing out the stem from the surplus metal of the
bowl (which contained several small “tears”) the
graceful and beautiful effect of the air spiral <em>inside the
stem</em> was produced. Sometimes the spiral starts within
the bowl; sometimes it winds
round the base of the bowl; but
always the ornamentation becomes
a trellis-work or network
when it fills up the whole stem;
when it does not fill up the whole
stem, it meanders down it medially,
in one substantial spiral, like
a corkscrew or a rope, or in two
that interlace: and in the finest
examples the finger can feel no
ridging of the surface at all,
though a slight ridging is palpable
in many glasses. Now all this
meant splendid workmanship&mdash;English
aptitude at handicraft, the
best of its kind in the world.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 190px;">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="190" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">DRAWN BOWL AND AIR-SPIRAL
STEM, BEGINNING
BELOW THE
BOWL</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the spiral is so very brilliant that it seems
as if it were made of quicksilver, and collectors call it
“silver spiral” or “brilliant air-twist”; but this is probably
an effect of light. In all cases the air spiral is glass
colour, the tint of the rest of the glass; red, cotton-white,
and blue spirals belong to the type of stem to be
mentioned next. Sometimes, it is true, a white thread
is seen running down the centre of the stem, within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
network of air spirals; but oftener when this central
thread occurs, it is “air-colour” itself.</p>

<p>Air spirals are often seen in stems of knobby or
baluster form; sometimes air-spiral stems have “necks.”
This probably means that long rods of glass containing
air spirals were made, with the baluster shape recurring
at regular intervals of suitable length, so that the rod
could be cut up into lengths and each length welded on
to the bowl and the foot of a glass. These are the air-spiral
glasses most sought after. Sometimes the stem
of a drawn glass was welded to a foot of which a bulb
was the upper part, this bulb sometimes containing
beadlike “tears,” but these are very rare: sometimes
the upper part of the stem is plain, and the lower part,
beginning with a knob, is air spiral, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. Sometimes
old air-spiral glasses with small feet are found;
this was due to a practice of grinding away the edge,
when the feet had become chipped by much use, and
re-polishing the feet of these much-valued glasses;
the folded foot for these glasses was not the rule.</p>

<p>Tall, slender-bowled air-spiral glasses for champagne
are sometimes found, in shape resembling the glasses
called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flûtes</i>; I own one of this sort not less than 9½
inches high. Rarer still are spiral-stemmed glasses for
ale; I own one 11 inches high (see <a href="#candlestick">illustration</a>, page 60).
The former I gave 7s. 6d. for, the latter 10s., a tithe of
their West-End prices. But these are very exceptional
glasses.</p>

<p>Air-spiral stems are found in cordial and spirit glasses,
firing glasses, and goblets with short stems.</p>

<h3>5. THE COTTON-WHITE SPIRAL STEM</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="400" height="491" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TALL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES: (1) TAPE
COTTON-WHITE, AND (2) AIR-SPIRAL
STEMS</div>
</div>

<p>During the latter half of the eighteenth century the
air-spiral glasses continued to be made, but the opaque
or cotton-white spiral stems came into fashion and
general use. These
were not “drawn”
stems; they could
not be, because the
white glass was not
inherent in the metal.
The stem was made
by lining a long cylindrical
mould with
wirelike “canes” of
cotton-white and
other glass alternately.
Then melted
plain glass was
poured into the cylinder.
The canes
adhered to the warm metal, and when the whole was
reheated, it could be twisted into spiral designs. Then
the parti-coloured rod thus made was cut into stem-lengths.
By this means a great variety of designs in
the spirals could be produced, and indeed, the countless
differences in English-made cotton-white spirals, hardly
any two alike, are one of the features of a collection.
Sometimes the design spreads like the air-twist; sometimes
it circles around a central, wavy tube; sometimes
the cotton-white is tapelike, in a “Greek key” pattern;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
sometimes an outer spiral runs around the inner corkscrew;
but always the effect is pleasing, and rather
striking, though perhaps not quite in the reticent good
taste of the air-spiral stems.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="280" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">STRAIGHT-SIDED, COTTON-WHITE
GREEK
KEY PATTERN</div>
</div>

<p>Dome feet or folded feet are hardly ever found under
cotton-white or other coloured spiral stems; any
example of that should at once be
acquired; but the pontil-mark is
always found&mdash;<em>if the glass be old</em>.
The white in English-made glasses
is generally a pure, vivid, cotton-white;
in Dutch glasses it is
usually a dull greyish hue. (This
is why I use the term “cotton-white”
as descriptive of these
English stems.)</p>


<h3>6. COLOURED SPIRAL STEMS</h3>

<p>The next step, to coloured or
“mixed” spirals, was obvious,
but not very often taken at English
glassworks: most of the
red and white spiral stems now seen came from
Holland or Liège. However, at Bristol red and
white, and blue and white, spiral stems were made;
they are known by the ruby red and the peculiar Bristol
blue. Yellow and white, purple and white, and green
and white spirals are known; rare indeed is a three-colour
spiral. Coloured twist stems were only made in
England about the end of the eighteenth century. An
almost constant feature of tri-coloured stems made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Holland or at Liège is a wavy central tube of white,
with coloured spirals around it, swelling or contracting
to suit the usually bulbous shape of the stem.</p>


<h3>7. CUT PLAIN-GLASS STEMS</h3>

<p>These seem to have been in fashion during the period
1775&ndash;1825. Usually the stems are hexagonal, and the
cutting had, of course, to be continued, in a shallow way,
on the lower part of the bowl. “Thistle” glasses are
those in which the cutting of the stem and bowl to some
extent suggests the thistle in shape and appearance.
The stems were often knopped&mdash;this is a feature of
Waterford glass cut stems&mdash;but towards the end of the
period mentioned above the stems became cylindrical
except for the cutting, and the cutting did not so much
produce facets as long grooves.</p>

<p>The dates just given would suggest that the dome
foot and the folded foot are not to be looked for under
cut stems, but they are met with, the dome foot having
been kept in use for ornament’s sake, probably. Nor is
the pontil-mark present, if the cutter removed it; except
that sometimes he left just the faintest trace of it, which
the finger can detect.</p>

list of collectable glasses on stems; there
are many desirable stemmed glasses once

cider, perry, or
spirits, to be

<h3>1. ALE AND
BEER GLASSES</h3>

<div class="caption">CANDLESTICK BETWEEN TALL BEER GLASSES</div>
</div>

<p>Many glasses,
drawn, bell,
or waisted-bell
shape in bowl
and baluster,
plain round, air
spiral, cotton-white
spiral, or
cut in stem, exist, which appear to have been used
for the very strong ale then brewed; often these are
engraved with representations of hops and barley.</p>

<p>Large vessels, perhaps used for “small beer,” exist,
from 9 to 16 inches tall, and proportionately capacious:
the biggest of the kind I ever saw was engraved with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Jacobite emblems. The smaller examples of this class
may have been used daily; the larger may have been
kept for occasional use as loving-cups, or were never
used at all, perhaps, being merely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours de force</i> of the
glass-maker, and kept as ornaments to a sideboard.
The very large ones are drawn glasses, with plain round
stems, as a rule; the nine-or ten-inch tall glasses of this
kind are baluster or plain round in stem. I bought one
of these (see <a href="#largeale">page 48</a>) for £2 5s. not long ago; its West-End
price now might be £10, for it is “Waterford.”</p>


<h3>2. CIDER GLASSES</h3>

<p>No doubt some of the glasses mentioned just above
were used at times for strong cider; perhaps large
goblets were used for draught perry or cider at times.
But special cider glasses exist, engraved with representations
of apples and apple-tree leaves, or apple-trees,
and these, from 6 to 7 inches tall, have ogee or rectangular
bowls as a rule, and usually cotton-white spiral
stems.</p>


<h3>3. CHAMPAGNE OR MUM GLASSES</h3>

<p>There are two types of old champagne or mum glasses,
each rare: one type has a wide-lipped bell or double-ogee
bowl, upon a baluster stem, and much resembles
some of the bigger sweetmeat glasses; the other type is
7 to 9 inches high, ogee bowl, and cotton-white stem.</p>


<h3>4. RUMMERS AND MUGS</h3>

<p>There were three shapes of rummers used, one goblet
shape, one on a tall stem, and one on a stem which is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a base: sometimes the base of an old rummer is square.
The first of these three shapes has a baluster stem, the
second a plain round, spiral, or cut stem.</p>

<p>Fine mugs, with handles, imitating contemporary old
silverware, are found; the mugs show something of a
stem (see <a href="#largemug">illustration</a>, page 7). Often they are engraved
with the initials of their first owner, and sometimes are
dated also. Fine double-handled mugs, like loving-cups,
exist.</p>

<h3>5. SPIRIT GLASSES AND CORDIAL GLASSES</h3>

<p>These are small in bowl and short in stem, the bowl
is often straight-sided, and the stem is usually drawn,
and often cut. But there are many with drawn bowls
and plain stems. A “thistle” glass of this kind is
specially valued. Often the bowl is engraved. Cordial
glasses may have long stems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>6. COACHING GLASSES AND FUDDLING GLASSES</h3>

<p>These are glasses which have no feet: they were used
at one draught of the liquor in them. I bought a Bristol
opal glass of the kind for 6d., but these are excessively
rare. Almost as rare are the plain glasses, with cut
stems, used in coaching days. When the stage coach
paused at an inn, a waiter came out with a tray of footless
glasses, each resting on its bowl; the traveller took one
up, inverted it into the proper position, held it out to the
bottle or decanter in the waiter’s hand, drank, and set the
glass down upon its bowl again. A fuddling glass was a
variety of coaching glass used indoors, for a rapid dram;
a “thistle” glass of this kind was favoured in Scotland.</p>

<h3>7. TOASTMASTER GLASSES</h3>

<p>These are less capacious dram glasses than they seem;
the lower part of the bowl was deceptively made very
thick, so that the toastmaster at a banquet need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
drink so much as would otherwise have been necessary,
when announcing and sharing in every one of the score
or two of the toasts and “sentiments” which were
honoured at every convivial board. A relic of the
“sentiment” habit was preserved by Dickens in the
language of Mr. Dick Swiveller: “May the wing of
friendship never moult a feather” was a “sentiment”
in its day.</p>


<h3>8. “HOGARTH” GLASSES</h3>

<p>Certain short, short-stemmed, or almost stemless
glasses, with “Norwich” feet often, and with drawn or
waisted-bell bowls wide at the mouth, are known as
“Hogarth” glasses, because they were often shown in
Hogarth’s pictures of contemporary social life.</p>


<h3>9. TAVERN AND KITCHEN GLASSES</h3>

<p>Old glasses are often found which in shape and purpose
correspond with those described in this chapter and
chapters vi, vii, and viii, but were obviously inferior in
finish of make when new. These may be taken to be
glasses made cheaply for tavern and kitchen use;
though not so attractive as the better qualities, they
should not be neglected by the collector.</p>


<h3>10. YARD OF ALE GLASSES</h3>

<p>Evelyn tells in his diary that in 1683 the health of
James II was drunk at Bromley “in a flint glass of a yard
long.” Imitations of these are made, but the real old
ones are excessively rare. In shape they rather resemble
a coaching-horn, the mouthpiece being the foot, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
mouthpiece being replaced by a bulb. They were used
at merry-makings, as proof of bibulous skill in emptying
a glass a yard long. There are also half-yard glasses.</p>


<h3>11. “THIMBLEFUL” GLASSES</h3>

<p>These have a very small straight-sided or ogee bowl,
upon a plain round, or spiral stem and big foot. They
are very rare.</p>

<div class="caption">JACOBITE GLASS SHOWING
THE STUART ROSE: ALSO

</div>

<p>The dearest aim of every
collector of old wine glasses is
to come upon a Jacobite glass.
The more sanguine and less
strict kind of collector declares
himself the owner of a Jacobite
example if he possesses a glass
engraved with a six-petalled
heraldic Stuart rose (one petal
for each King or Queen of
Stuart blood who actually
reigned in England, he says),
a large bud (representing the
Old Pretender, he explains), a
smaller bud (for the Young
Pretender), and a bird or (see <a href="#quality">illustration</a>, page 20)
butterfly (crossing the narrow seas, he explains, to bring
the Stuarts back).</p>

</div>

<p class="pclear">A stricter, less easily satisfied collector points out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
those were “the ordinary rose glasses,” used at all
fashionable dinner-tables in the eighteenth century (see
<a href="#rose">illustration</a>, page 59). The reply to that is that the six-petalled
rose and one of the buds, at least, are heraldic,
not naturally represented; that the heraldic, six-petalled
white rose was the Stuart rose; and that, at any rate, the
“ordinary rose glasses” were sometimes used by Jacobites,
particularly in general assemblies, because of their covert
meaning, when it would have been unsafe to use the
treasonable Jacobite glasses proper. A slight addition to
the rose glass makes it truly Jacobite; thus I own a fine
goblet which is made Jacobite by a monk’s-hood flower
being added&mdash;a reference to General Monk. An “ordinary
rose glass”&mdash;not so ordinary after all, and difficult to
procure now, as well as dear to buy&mdash;which has a Stuart
emblem engraved <em>under</em> the foot of it is allowed to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
muster by the stricter collector, but what he aims at or
boasts of if he possesses one is a “Jacobite glass proper.”</p>


<h3>THE “JACOBITE”</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="300" height="492" alt="" />
<div class="caption">JACOBITE “FIRING” GLASS,
SHOWING THE OAKLEAF AND
THE WORD “FIAT”</div>
</div>

<p>Now a “Jacobite glass proper” is engraved with a
portrait of the Old Pretender, or of his son “Bonnie
Prince Charlie”; or with
the rose, two buds, a butterfly
or a bird, and also a
Jacobite motto or emblem,
or both; or with the cypher
of the Old Pretender and
the words of a loyalist
song. Upon a firing glass
(the rarest of the Jacobite
variety) may be seen the
touching emblem of a
thunder-smitten tree putting
forth new branches,
and the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Revirescit</i>
(It becomes green again).
Upon a wine glass may be
seen the word “Fiat” with
a star (perhaps standing for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat lux</i>, “Let there be light,”
or perhaps for “Let it be done”&mdash;the second Restoration
of the Stuarts). Or the motto may be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Redeat</i> (let him
return), or, very rare, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Redi</i>; or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Radiat</i> (perhaps a misspelling
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Redeat</i>, or possibly meant for “let him
shine”). If an oak-leaf (as well as the other features)
appear on the glass, it was probably used in England;
if a thistle, probably in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>There still are a few Jacobite glasses lying unrecognised
no doubt; two were found in a London broker’s shop
a few years ago, and bought for 5s.; in 1914 a Bristol
schoolmaster learned accidentally that two glasses which
had stood on a shelf on a sideboard in the family for forty
years were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fiat</i> glasses, and a valuer going to a house
in Sussex for other purposes,
discovered a
Prince Charlie portrait
glass (worth a hundred
guineas now) still passing
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</i>&mdash;there had
been “the pair of it,”
but that had been
“smashed to bits,” the
servants said.</p>

<div class="caption">JACOBITE “FIRING” GLASS, SHOWING

</div>

<p>The rarest form of
Jacobite glasses is the
short toasting or firing
glass, for strong waters,
of “Hogarth” shape. I
possess one of these; it
has a “Norwich” foot;
the thickness of the base
of the bowl, and the “tear” in that and the short
bulbous stem, seem to date it at about 1725, so that it
will be an “Old Pretender” glass. It is very beautifully
engraved with the six-petalled rose, the two
buds, the word “Fiat,” the rising star and the (Boscobel)
oak-leaf. It had been kept in an armoury,
belonging to a collector who did not collect old glass.</p>

<p>No wonder people hunt for Jacobite glasses. They
were the romantic, loyal, treasonable vessels which
were emptied to the
toast of “his Majesty
over the water,” in
clandestine and dangerous
gatherings of fair
women and conspiring
men. Then the great
punch-bowl was filled
with water, to represent
the narrow seas,
and the red wine
sparkled in the glasses
held out above it; as
often at loyal Georgian
assemblies a
Jacobite would be seen
to hold his wine glass
above a tumbler of
water, if called on to
drink to “the King”:</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Then all leapt up and joined their hands<br /></i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>With hearty clasp and greeting,<br /></i></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Over the wide bowl meeting:<br /></i></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>Flip these old glasses with the finger-nail, and they
ring like a tuning-fork; draw thumb and finger upwards
to the edge of the bowl, and you hear a clear faint
resonance, sad as the wailings after Culloden, when final
defeat had come.</p>


<h3>THE “WILLIAMITE”</h3>

<p>I bought two fine, perfect, baluster-stemmed Williamite
glasses for a guinea once; they show William of Orange
on horseback, and are inscribed with “The Glorious
Memory of King William, No Surrender, Boyne, 1st.
Iuly 1690”; and the initials “T.C” and “S.C”; on
some such glasses two of the initials are “S.T.” (see
<a href="#williamite">illustration</a>, page 47). The glass is a yellowish-white
where it is thick, and if not made at Belfast, may have
been made in Cork; but the engraving would be done
in Ulster. Some such glasses are rather recent; no
doubt the making of Williamite glasses continued longer
than the making of Jacobite glasses did, because of the
continued existence of Orange Lodges. Some of these
glasses are inscribed “The Immortal Memory” only,
or “To the glorious memory of King William” only.
Williamite firing glasses, of “Hogarth” shape, are
also found.</p>


<h3>THE “HANOVERIAN”</h3>

<p>When the House of Hanover came to the throne
of the United Kingdom, loyal drinking glasses were
made accordingly. “God save King George” and
“Liberty” are the usual inscriptions on them; sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the heraldic white horse of Hanover was engraved
on the bowl, or the three crosses of the Union Jack
inside a garter and the rays of the sun. Hanoverian
glasses are rarer than Jacobite or Williamite, but Jacobite
glasses are the most valued and costly.</p>

<h2><a name="XI_TUMBLERS_TANKARDS" id="XI_TUMBLERS_TANKARDS"></a>XI. TUMBLERS, TANKARDS,
“JOEYS,” AND “BOOT”
GLASSES</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">I class</span> these together because they are stemless.
Pewter and silver tankards were imitated in glass,
and these differ from mugs in being straight-sided
and quite stemless; often they were engraved with
initials and dates.</p>

<p>Old tumblers are not found so numerously as old wine
glasses are; they are usually large, are often cut, and
are sometimes engraved. Some tumblers are barrel-shaped,
like some rummers, but most tumblers are
“straight-sided” or “rectangular.” Some tumblers are
engraved with portraits (as of Admiral Keppel) or with
inscriptions (as of “Wellington for ever”). I own two
which celebrate the “Independence of Durham and
Richd. Wharton its defender,” probably made at
Sunderland in 1802, to commemorate a Parliamentary
Election in which the freedom of the citizens of Durham
from rule by the bishop’s bailiff was involved. Masonic
tumblers are rare; so are Bristol opal-glass tumblers, yet
I own one which cost me 1s.</p>

<p>“Joeys” are dram glasses, shaped like tumblers, or
like fuddling glasses with no foot or stem (see <a href="#joeys">illustration</a>,
page 62). Mr. Joseph Hume, M.P., had caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fourpenny bits to be coined; fourpenny bits were
accordingly called “joeys”; even to-day people call for
a “joey” of brandy. When a tax was put on gin, less
of the liquor could then be sold for fourpence; so that
the glass was made thicker, and the contents accordingly
less. For a similar reason to-day there are in public-houses
glasses called “Lloyd Georges,” I am told. The
two “joeys” I
own are of grass-green
hue; one
is inscribed with
“4d.”</p>

<div class="caption">SMALL BOOT GLASSES</div>
</div>

<p>“Boot” glasses
are small
blown vessels in
the shape of
riding-boots,
probably used
for spirits in
the parting
dram, otherwise called the stirrup-cup. There seems
little foundation for the suggestion that these were
emblems of Lord Bute, in the days of George III; for
as Mr. Hartshorne, the founder of glass-collecting,
discovered, a jack-boot glass is preserved in the museum
of Liège and another in a Dutch museum, and these
are older and more elaborate than the English “boot”
glasses. I own two of those which Mr. Hartshorne
collected, and on which he based the “Bute” suggestion,
but small “boot” glasses are exceedingly rare. A big
one, cut, and 12 inches high, was once offered me; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
think it came from Liège. Large boot glasses striped
with white are seen sometimes; “boot” glasses can
hardly have been peculiar to Great Britain. Perhaps
they were used by hunting men as an emblem of their
sport.</p>

<h2><a name="XII_BOTTLES_DECANTERS" id="XII_BOTTLES_DECANTERS"></a>XII. BOTTLES, DECANTERS,
AND JUGS</h2>


<h3>BOTTLES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Trapnell collection contained an early
seventeenth-century bottle, with a seal of a king’s
head; another dated Henry Galshell, 1700;
another inscribed T. Bellamy, 1773. I own one bearing
“C. Yoxall, 1778” in raised letters on a raised lozenge.
These are all of dark, thick glass, and are short-necked
and tun-bellied. A little later, in 1786, for instance,
the shape became like that of a beer bottle to-day, but
larger.</p>

<p>The rectangular, shouldered spirit bottles, with
separately made short necks, and engraved or gilded,
are usually Dutch, and were perhaps enclosed in cases,
something like “tantalus” bottles. There are tall,
embossed spirit bottles, often of coloured glass, with
cut-glass stoppers. There are cut-glass English bottles,
decanter-shaped but stopperless, a cork being used.
Holster bottles were a kind of flask carried in the saddle
holster. Bottles for oil and vinegar and spices resembled
cruet bottles as a rule. Scent bottles, large, in plain
glass, are found; small scent bottles, cut or coloured,
or mounted with silver or pinchbeck stoppers, exist in
great numbers; I own a Bristol scent bottle which is cut
like a shell cameo, through two layers of coloured glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
one pink, one opal, down to the basal layer of plain glass;
it cost me 6s. 6d.</p>


<h3>DECANTERS</h3>

<p>During most of the eighteenth century wine came to
table in bottles; “decanting” began to be the fashion
about 1780, perhaps. The decanters of that date have
sloping shoulders as a rule; some in shape resemble
a drawn glass with short stem reversed; a little later
decanters became more globular and high-shouldered,
with shorter necks. Engraved festoons on a decanter, as
indeed upon a wine glass, usually indicate the “Empire”
period by their decoration&mdash;the end of the eighteenth
century, if not the beginning of the next. It must be
said, however, that some “Jacobite” decanters exist with
long necks and globular bodies; so difficult is it to find
a rule without an exception in old glass. These Jacobite
decanters have pointed stoppers, too; whereas oval
rounded stoppers seem generally to have been the early
form.</p>


<h3>JUGS</h3>

<p>Ale jugs, wine jugs, and water jugs in plain, coloured,
or cut glass are plentiful. The most desirable are
Waterford made, known by the tint, the weight, and the
cutting. Cork-made jugs, resembling Waterford-made
in cutting, but yellowish in tint, are found. Bristol
coloured jugs, Wrockwardine striped and Nailsea
splashed glass jugs exist; these, like many other old plain
glass jugs, are blown and not cut. Jugs with very large
necks and lips, either blown or cut, are fairly early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
examples. Sometimes a plain glass jug will have a
raised festoon of plain or coloured glass about its
neck.</p>

<p>Milk and cream jugs in Bristol blue, opal, or ruby
glass are well known; cut milk-jugs exist in fair
number.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Large</span> cut-glass bowls, and plain bowls, exist,

of cut glass
are found.
Coloured glass

glass so
much as a

<p>The <em>toddy lifter</em>, <em>punch lifter</em>, or <em>grog lifter</em> is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
interesting glass article; I own seven, though examples
are quite rare. There are several shapes. When the lower
part is a high-shouldered decanter shape it is said to be a
punch lifter, and English; when the lower part is round
and shoulderless, like a club, it is Scottish and a toddy
lifter. In most cases there is a fillet or collar of glass
round the neck, and these are called ring-necked;
the absence of the ring is rare. The bowl is of the size
required for an ordinary glassful, for the lifters were
used to transfer punch, toddy, or grog from the punch-bowl
to the glass. The earlier way of doing this was
by a silver or wooden ladle, but about the year 1800 the
glass lifter (which is really a pipette or siphon) came into
use. When the base of the lifter sank into the punch,
the punch rose into the bowl of it by a hole in the bottom
of it; the thumb then closed the hole at the top of the
neck, thus creating a vacuum. Then the lifter could be
carried over the table to the glass, and when the thumb
was taken away the punch ran down into the glass.</p>

<p>Glass sugar crushers, plain, cut, or ridged with spirals,
are found, with a pestle-like end to them. Glass spoons
are rare. Glass knives are found, but most of them are
doubtful. Pestles of Nailsea glass are seen, perhaps
once used by ladies in their still-rooms; maybe glass
mortars to match them may turn up.</p>

<p>Knife rests for the table are found, some plain moulded,

<p>Glass candlesticks of Georgian date follow much the
same order as the contemporary wine glasses, in the
feet, pontil-marks, and stems. The earliest have
baluster stems about 9 inches high, and round feet
between 6 and 7 inches in diameter; the feet are
domed or high instep, and the pontil-mark is a lump.
The dome foot occurs with the air-spiral stems, later,
and even with the cut stems, later still; in these last,
as in the moulded and in the cut and engraved examples,
the pontil-mark does not show. Fine candlesticks
ornamented by purfling were made (see <a href="#candlestick">illustration</a>,
page 60). Glass taper stands are found.</p>


<h3>2. LUSTRES</h3>

<p>The degenerate form of lustre that was found on every
parlour mantelpiece about the year 1860 is the best-known
form, and many of these coloured glass objects,
belling out at the top and bottom, with hanging prisms
fantastically cut, are still extant; but as yet they are
little collected. The name “lustres,” however, may be
used to include the standing girandoles and the hanging
chandeliers adorned with festoons of diamond-like cut
prisms, and these are much sought after; many collectors
acquire loose prisms, long or diamond-shaped,
whenever they can, and have them re-strung, to be added
to new glass chandeliers.</p>

<p>The earliest form of the girandole, or standing lustre,
had a glass standard and glass arms; the top of the
standard was a candlestick nozzle; the glass standard and
arms and the dependent prisms reflected the candlelight
brilliantly. Two of these were in use at Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Vernon when George Washington was President of the
United States; in the <cite>Boston News Letter</cite> for 1719,
“Fine Glass Lamps and Lanthorns” were advertised.
Later, French influence brought in the ormolu and brass
standards, some two feet high with ormolu arms and
glass hangers. A complete set of girandoles, for a
mantelpiece or console-stand, consisted of three, with
ormolu bases (sometimes representing a human figure),
standards, and arms; the central one triply or quintuply
a candlestick, the side ones singly so.</p>

<p>In the fine tall lustres made in pairs at Cork about
1820 all was glass, except the metal clips inserted in
the nozzles to hold the candles better. Until lustres
lost their meaning and became mere mantel ornaments
the candlestick part of them was a usual feature.</p>


<h3>3. LAMPS</h3>

<p>Glass standard lamps, some with round bases, some
with square bases, the stems cut or balustered, may be
found; in some cases the standard is short and supports
a blown-glass lampshade; in other cases a blown-glass
bulb is part of the tall standard.</p>

<p>A rare and interesting form of lamp, one of the oldest,
has a bulb with an opening in the top, the edges of the
opening rounded off, and a corrugated stand; these are
small, and were used for nightlights. I own three, one
of them with a handle, and a dish beneath it, evidently
used for carrying the light from room to room (see
<a href="#caddy">illustration</a>, page 27); such as these would, perhaps, be
the old “mortars,” or night-light holders, for a cake of
wax and a wick.</p>

<h3>COMPORTS</h3>

<div class="caption">COMPORT, WITH CAPTAIN GLASS AND SWEETMEAT
GLASS; ALL THREE SHOWING THE
“INVERTED OBELISK” STEM</div>
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">A comport</span> is a large glass stand upon which
(as the name signifies) other things may be
carried together. A comport consists of a large
or largish glass
disc, flat, with a
rim to it, upheld
upon a thick
stem&mdash;most
often a shouldered
stem, in
shape resembling
an inverted
obelisk, rising
from a domed
and folded foot.
An old comport
is a rare possession;
a modern
glass cake-stand,
such as confectioners
use, is
a near approach to it in shape. The use of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
comport appears to have been to stand on a dining-table,
bearing a number of glasses filled with jelly or
sweetmeats.</p>


<h3>SWEETMEAT GLASSES</h3>

<p>Old sweetmeat glasses were used at table much as
bon-bon dishes are now, to pass round at the dessert
course; or to hand to ladies at other than mealtimes,
during a call. Sweetmeat glasses proper resemble
wine glasses, but have wide bowls, thick-lipped, unsuitable
for drinking from: the shape of the stem resembled
that of the stem of the comport. Often these glasses
were engraved.</p>

<h3>“CAPTAIN” OR “MASTER” GLASSES</h3>

<p>In the centre of the comport, surrounded by sweetmeat
glasses, a bigger, taller “captain” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> “master”
glass stood; its shape resembled that of the smaller
glasses, and it probably held a store from which these
could be replenished. “Captain” glasses are much
sought for; the most valuable are Waterford cut, the
West-End price for one being now £8.</p>

<div class="caption">JELLY GLASSES. NOTE THE MOULDED ORNAMENT</div>

<p>The bowls are usually varieties of the double ogee;
the moulded stem is usually high-shouldered, inverted
obelisk in shape, but air-spiral and cotton-white spiral
stems are found (see <a href="#captain">illustration</a>, page 1). A cut stem
is usually knopped, but may be plain round, except for
the cutting.</p>


<h3>JELLY GLASSES</h3>

<p>Jelly glasses are small, low, moulded or pressed,
almost stemless, on domed or high instep feet; sometimes
the bowls are plain blown or moulded, sometimes
cut, sometimes hexagonal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3>CUSTARD GLASSES</h3>

<p>The most desirable custard glasses have handles.
Some of them have square bases. Some of them
resemble smallish wine glasses with corrugated
stems. Most of them are decorated by pressed or
incised lines.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI_SALT_CELLARS_PEPPER_BOXES" id="XVI_SALT_CELLARS_PEPPER_BOXES"></a>XVI. SALT CELLARS, PEPPER BOXES,
SUGAR BASINS, ETC.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> “Sunderland” salt cellars have already been
mentioned (see <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>); moulded or cut-glass
salt cellars are much less rare. The oldest of
these seem to be those with oval bowls, in the Queen
Anne silver style, with diamond-shape bases on short
stems, everywhere cut. Some salt cellars have turned-over
tops, much broader than the rest of the vessel;
there are Bristol striped salt cellars of this shape. In
some cut salt cellars the lines run horizontally. Victorian
salt cellars were very heavy and rather plain.</p>

<p>Pepper boxes of glass are round, or octagonal, plain
or cut, with or without a foot; holes are pierced in the
top, there is a glass stopper at the bottom; sometimes
the base is square and the pierced top is of silver. In
some cases the vessel was used for castor-sugar.</p>

<p>Sugar-basins exist in numbers, and in plain, cut, opal,
and coloured glass, notably in the Bristol blue. There
are covered sugar basins; when these are large and cut
they are known as sugar bowls. A special type is the
<em>caddy sugar-basin</em> (see <a href="#Page_27">page 27</a>); this was usually of
straight-sided form, blown, moulded, or cut, or both
moulded and cut; it stood in the central receptacle of
a tea-caddy, within the round hole between the two
rectangular boxes which held green tea and black tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
respectively. These basins are much more seldom met
with than the caddies are. Often they are very heavy,
and nearly always they are very ornamental. Bristol
opal-glass sugar and slop basins are met with; in this
glass complete tea-sets were made, including tea poys
or glass tea-caddies. In the Willett collection was
“a Bristol glass teapot and cover, with flowers in
colours.” A glass teapot is rarely found.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII_MIRRORS_GLASS_PICTURES" id="XVII_MIRRORS_GLASS_PICTURES"></a>XVII. MIRRORS, GLASS PICTURES,
GLASS KNOBS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Mirrors</span> more properly come within the
category of furniture, but they largely consist
of glass, of course, so that some notice of them
is needed here.</p>

<p>In 1688 the art of casting large plates of glass began
to be carried on in France. In 1663 the art had been
patented in England, but for smaller sizes. One French
mirror, now in the Louvre at Paris, was valued at
£6000 in 1791. Glass used to be a costly product;
the chief reason why old prints are usually found
trimmed of their margins was that glass to frame with
them was so dear.</p>

<p>Old <em>mirrors</em> with bevelled edges have the bevel flattish,
nearly in the plane of the glass; the bevel follows the
shape of the frame, but is irregular at its inner outlines,
because the grinding of the bevel was done by hand.
Modern bevels, done by machinery, are almost mathematically
exact, and make an acuter angle with the frame
than the old bevels do. Also the silvering at the back
of old mirrors differs from the method of silvering now
used; the difference is much more easy to recognize
by the eye than to describe, but there is a kind of granulation
in the older backing.</p>

<p><em>Glass pictures</em> are of two kinds; one in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
painting, in oil-colours, was done upon the glass itself,
usually at the back of it; and another in which the paint
was laid on coarsely behind a print which, rubbed very
thin at the back of the paper, had been affixed to the
back of the glass. This second kind is the more numerously
met with; also it is the most counterfeited. Age
may be known, however, by the curving, bubbly surface
of the glass. A third kind, consisting of a mosaic of
bits of glass, so laid together in cement as to form a
picture is rare, even in modern examples.</p>

<p>Glass <em>knobs</em> to handsome sideboards were used in the
first quarter of the nineteenth century, and have continually
been used in Yorkshire, for dressers, since then;
old glass knobs are usually moulded, but some are cut,
though the round, uncut shape was the most convenient
for handling. Glass door-knobs are found.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII_OLD_PASTE_GLASS_BEADS" id="XVIII_OLD_PASTE_GLASS_BEADS"></a>XVIII. OLD PASTE, GLASS BEADS,
AND TAWS</h2>


<h3>PASTE</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">All</span> artificial “stones” used in jewellery are
glass&mdash;glass variously shaped, cut, and coloured&mdash;but
“<em>old paste</em>” is glass not coloured;
though it may be backed with coloured foil, which shows
a tint through the glass. Old-paste collecting is, therefore,
a branch of old-glass collecting, and cannot be
ignored in this book.</p>

<p>White paste is usually a substitute for diamonds;
the carefully made and cut old paste or strass (the French
name for it, adopted under Louis V, when the best paste
was made) came very near the look of diamonds.
Paste or strass is glass of a very hard, bright kind, cut
in the way in which diamonds are cut, and mounted in
the metals and styles which usually go with diamond
jewellery.</p>

<p>Behind these brilliant bits of cut-glass, silver or tinfoil
was put, so that light falling through the glass should
be refracted and reflected back, as it is in natural crystals
such as diamonds. Time affects the colour of this foil
and thus gives a softer beauty to the effect. Old paste
is more beautiful than new paste for another reason, too&mdash;being
old glass it has the tints of old glass so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
referred to in this book. Some paste seems to have
been made at Bristol, for “Bristows” or “Bristol
diamonds” some of it is called.</p>

<p>The older paste ornaments have the bits of glass set
separately, each setting for each bit separate though
touching each other, and therefore there is much metal
shown in the settings; this applies to the seventeenth-century
paste. Later, near the end of the eighteenth
century and afterwards, as now, the bits of glass were
sunk within a continuous grooved or hollow setting,
each bit held in place by a small claw or raised clip of
metal soldered on to the general groove. The setting
for white paste was usually silver: coloured pastes were
often set in gold, silver gilt, pinchbeck, bronze, and
sometimes in pewter.</p>

<p>Paste consisting of very small pieces is preferable to
the larger varieties. “Diamond” paste is oftener
found than “emerald,” “ruby,” or “sapphire” paste.
A certain form of paste (not truly paste) is found in
jewellery set with glass cut and silvered at the back, as
if it were a bit of looking-glass.</p>

<p>A test for the age of paste is the presence of
scratches on its surface, and of dimness brought
about by chemical action of the air. The scratches
are oftenest found at the edges and flats of the
facets.</p>


<h3>GLASS BEADS AND TAWS</h3>

<p>Glass <em>beads</em> have been made ever since the making of
glass was known, in Egypt, Europe, and here. The
general tests of age given in this book may be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to them. Glass <em>taws</em> or marbles made for boys’ games,
or for a game called “solitaire” which used to be fashionable&mdash;a
kind of “patience” game with glass taws&mdash;used
to show the characteristics of air-spiral or cotton-white
or coloured spiral stems.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX_GENERAL_HINTS_AND" id="XIX_GENERAL_HINTS_AND"></a>XIX. GENERAL HINTS AND
WARNINGS</h2>


<h3>INSCRIBED GLASSES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">A collector</span> should not miss an opportunity
of buying an inscribed glass cheaply: for
instance, a naval rummer, engraved with a
cutlass, a dove with the olive-branch, and “Our brave
Allies” for 4s. But fine engraved and inscribed modern
glasses, imitating though not reproducing exactly the old
ones, are on sale in curio-shops.</p>


<h3>ROSES, OAK-LEAVES, BIRDS, AND BUTTERFLIES
ON GLASS</h3>

<p>Eventually any glass with roses, rosebuds, and a bird
or butterfly on it will rank as “Jacobite”; glasses with
oak-leaves will also be thought symbolical of Boscobel.
Other such emblems will be discovered, or are alleged;
for instance, the aconite or monk’s-hood flower, considered
as an aspiration for another General Monk, who
might restore the Stuart line.</p>


<h3>OLD GLASSES “ENGRAVED UP”</h3>

<p>Jacobite, Williamite, and Hanover or Trafalgar
glasses being in great demand, <em>ingenious persons take a
real old wine glass, goblet, or rummer, that is plain and
innocent at the time, and engrave it</em> with Jacobite emblems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
or “Bonny Prince Charlie’s” head, or William of Orange
on horseback, or “Trafalgar,” or “Nile.” As a rule
the evident newness, roughness, and lack of “wear” of
such added engraving condemn it, to the eye and to the
finger; but very ingenious persons use chemicals, or
mud, or attrition, in order to disguise the whitish-grey
tint of newly engraved glass; if part of the engraving
be “buffed” up&mdash;that is, polished till it is bright,
transparent, and not the tint of ground glass (see <a href="#jacobite">centre
of rose</a>, page 70), detection becomes more difficult.</p>


<h3>THE COLLECTOR’S INSTINCT</h3>

<p>But after a while the “instinct” of a collector comes
into play to protect him against these and other frauds.
He cannot exactly reason out and state why an offered
piece is “wrong,” but he feels that it is not right;
which means that the “altogether” of the glass suggests
to his subconscious mind something which, though not
expressed, is a good reason for not buying the glass.
But this “instinct” only comes after much practice in
collecting, and repeated turning of pages for reference,
in a book such as this; a collector’s books should not
be read once and then laid aside; they should be referred
to on every occasion, even after the “instinct”
has begun to stir.</p>


<h3>LIKELIHOOD AND IMPROBABILITY</h3>

<p>Extraordinary chances come to the “picking-up”
collector, I know, but he does well to keep in mind the
probability or the unlikelihood of his “find” being real.
It is unlikely that he should more than once happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
upon a Jacobite glass, for example; and again, if he
sees a fine “Trafalgar” glass exhibited in a small
jeweller’s shop, with no other glass at all or any other
“curios,” the probability is that some fraudulent person
has planted that false glass there, in what is a likely place
to attract and deceive a collector who “picks up.”</p>


<h3>THE ABSOLUTE FRAUDS</h3>

<p>Old English and Irish glass has <em>a soft and mellow tone,
both of look and sound; it has a calm, respectable, honest
appearance, as of quality and honesty combined. Fitness
for its purpose, good workmanship, some quaintness perhaps,
but not much fantasy, are visible in it</em>; if it is decorated,
<em>the decoration has been done well, but without lavish
artistic imagination</em>.</p>

<p>Now about the forgeries of it there is <em>something hard
and fast, an appearance too shiny and shining, and a rigidity
of copying</em>. Seldom are even two old glasses belonging
to a set quite alike, but the forgeries are exact replicas by
the hundred. See one, you see them all; but see one
real old glass, you notice differences in it from all others.
<em>Forged glass, recently made, is “buffed” or polished on the
wheel all over its surface; old glass was never buffed, and
its polish rather resembles that of old furniture due to
“elbow grease”</em>&mdash;the polish comes of long washing,
wiping, and drying.</p>

<p>I have already described the differences of tint.
Forged glasses are clumsy imitations in this, for the
forgers do not try to give the old dark tints&mdash;they use
lead that is not so impure as the old lead was, and therefore
produces less visible oxide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>cutting of old glass, done by hand, produced and
displays irregularities</em>; so does modern cutting. But <em>the
old irregularities were due to a lack of machine-like precision,
and were natural, accidental irregularities: the modern
irregularities are (so to speak) mechanical, and obviously
due to haste and cheapness of production</em>. Labour and
time were no great matters with the old workmen;
the counterfeit work is obviously done with the minimum
of labour and time.</p>

<p>Modern English-made glass has often a good ring
when flicked; foreign-made frauds on the old have not,
or have it seldom.</p>


<h3>THE “MODERN ANTIQUE”</h3>

<p>Much of the glass sold in the smaller curio-shops as
“antique” was not made to deceive: it is the offering
of it in such places which intends fraud. Most English-made
reproductions of old glass in shape and cutting
were not intended by the manufacturer to delude a
collector, but to attract the ordinary buyer for table use
or decorative use; one who is not a collector but “likes
something that looks old-fashioned,” as he says.</p>

<p>Pawnbrokers’ and jewellers’ shops are stocked with
what is called in the trade “the modern antique”;
other examples of this are the cheap, hasty, and obvious
copies of miniatures of famous beauties set in new paste
frames and sold for a few shillings. In pawnshops and
ordinary glass-shop windows a collector sees spiral-stem
wine glasses made for modern use and not intended to
deceive; they are a kind of tawdrily ornamental hock
glass, embodying some modern designer’s idea of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is beautiful; they correspond with no antique shape of
bowl, the stems are very thin and fragile, the feet are as
small as or smaller than the rim of the bowl, and the
spirals are parti-coloured and “tight.” No collector
need be taken in by such as these&mdash;they were not made
to take him in, they are ordinary articles of modern
manufacture and daily commerce.</p>

<p>So are the white glass bowls, tazzas, centre-pieces,
vases, “specimen glasses,” etc., elaborately cut, perhaps
engraved also, and meant for modern tables and mantelpieces.
These are copies of the fine old ware simply
because the old ware affords good models, and the information
given in chapter ii of this book will enable
a collector to recognize the modernity of these honest
imitations, even when they are found (as they often are)
in a shop supposed to purvey antiques.</p>


<h3>OUT-OF-THE-WAY PIECES</h3>

<p>I do not say that very unusual and out-of-the-way
pieces of old glass should be avoided; as the collecting
of glass increases, many rare old things will be brought
out of cupboards and sold in shops. But I do say
that, as a rule, a collector should feel suspicious of any
piece not resembling those which are pictured in books
like this, or those seen in museum collections. Thus a
tall, bulky goblet engraved with a portrait of William
Pitt or Wellington, and inscribed accordingly, if it is
offered for 30s., say, is highly suspicious, to say the least
of it; and the safer course is to refuse apparent bargains
of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<h3>FAKED JACOBITE GLASSES, ETC.</h3>

<p>This applies even more to the pseudo-Jacobite,
Williamite, Nelson, and other famous glasses which are
offered. They may be old glasses “engraved up,” in
which case the only mode of detection is the quality,
finish and tint of the engraving. They may be English-made
modern glass, of the right ring and the old way of
manufacture; in which case the test of tint in the glass
itself may be added to the test of the engraving. In
either case the engraving may too closely reproduce an
original glass; it is seldom that two old glasses of this
type exactly resemble each other in the position of the
various emblems, portraits, and so on: for example,
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fiat</i> is hardly ever found in exactly the same
place on two real old glasses. If the pseudo-Jacobite
or other engraved glass fails to respond to the characteristics
of high instep or domed foot, tint, ring, etc., or
any of these, it should be rejected.</p>


<h3>FAKED SPIRAL GLASSES</h3>

<p>Fraudulent air-spiral or cotton-spiral-stemmed
glasses, not engraved or inscribed, are the fraud most
often offered to a collector: in addition to the other tests
mentioned, <em>the test of the skill and quality of the spiral
itself can be used</em> in this case. The <em>counterfeits show
spirals which are meagre, irregular, tight, or the wrong
colour; they do not fill up the stem, or exactly swell out
to fill up the knops; in the cotton-white there are defects
resembling dropped threads in a piece of linen, or missed
stitches in a piece of lace</em>. I possess one excellently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
twisted air-spiral forgery, a simple cable, which might
deceive if the plain glass around it forming the rest of
the stem were not so thick and so distinct as to suggest
that the spiral was made first and the plain glass placed
around it afterwards; <em>the old spirals, air, cotton-white
or coloured, were twisted at the time of and in the actual
making of the whole stem</em>. Modern spiral stems are often
writhen or ridged on the surface, too; which means that
the twisting of the stem has been done with less than the
old amount of skill. In short, the making of spiral
stems is a lost art, not recovered even by the assiduous
forgers, up to the present.</p>

<p><em>If a spiral revolves upwards from right to left</em>&mdash;the
right to the left of the person looking at it&mdash;<em>reject it</em>;
this defect was a feature of the earlier forgeries, but the
proper direction of the upward twist (from left to right)
is now used in these fakes.</p>

<p>The old cut stems are more easily imitated: <em>with
these a test is the absence of all trace of a pontil-mark</em>.
In many old cut glasses the finger feels a distinct
depression, usually circular, which shows where the
old pontil-mark was cut away. In some forgeries,
made by moulding, not by blowing, the pontil-mark
is imitated, but so grossly that it ought not to
deceive.</p>


<h3>SHAM WINE COOLERS AND FINGER BOWLS</h3>

<p>Counterfeit eared wine coolers and beautifully cut
counterfeit finger bowls are on the curio market; the
usual tests should detect these. Imitation Bristol blue,
and violet glass is offered, but it is not the right blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which passes from a purple in the thick, to a sea-blue
in the thin, parts when held to the light; or not the right
violet, in which the same varying of colour is evident.
Dozens of fraudulent white and violet finger bowls,
elaborately cut, are on the market; but it is the rarest
thing to find more than five or six left of any set of old
finger bowls.</p>


<h3>OLD DUTCH GLASS</h3>

<p>Glassware of the seventeenth and eighteenth century
made in the Lowlands, whether at Liège or Amsterdam,
is known over here as “old Dutch.” Collectors will
do wisely to study this ware, whether for the purpose
of rejecting or acquiring it. Most collectors of English
and Irish glass reject it at once; they rightly say that
<em>when thin it is too light-weight, bubbly, flashy, flat and
short of ring, and when thick too smeary of tint and too
clumsy to be first class; and often the engraving is poor
and ugly</em>. Indeed, there is <em>something unfinished and unworkmanlike
about it</em>, compared with the craftsmanship
put into English and Irish old glass; just as there is
about Dutch-made furniture of William and Mary
and Queen Anne date, compared with English-made
furniture of the Chippendale period and style.
<em>There is something unsatisfactory in the look, shape,
and proportions; it seems to lack completeness and
fitness.</em></p>

<p>In the stemmed glasses, however, <em>the Dutch air spirals
are excellently done&mdash;except where they join the foot of
the glass, sometimes; and the cotton-white spirals are
hardly inferior to the English except in the greyness of the</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<em>colour</em>. For this reason, and also because the number
of collectors of old glass increases, Dutch wine glasses
on spiral stems go up in price at London auctions nowadays,
and a rose glass or other pretty, well-engraved
piece of Flemish or Dutch origin may be worth acquiring:
there are collectors here of the Holland ware
already, and there will be more as English and Irish
ware of the kind becomes more difficult to find and
expensive to buy. A spirit bottle, decanter, goblet, or
other piece of Dutch glass that is engraved with armorials
or dates, or names or legends, is not to be disdained,
therefore; nor is any unusual piece that is quaintly
quirked, fluted, purfled, and bossed.</p>


<h3>CHIPPED OR BROKEN PIECES</h3>

<p>It is sometimes worth while cheaply to acquire a
chipped or even a broken piece of old glass, if it is very
rare in kind, form, or purpose. Chipped feet of wine
glasses can be ground again, but it is hardly worth
while; when the foot is almost all gone, a metal substitute
can be made for it, but that is hardly worth while.
I know of a Jacobite glass with a big piece out of the
engraved portion cemented in again; the price of
the glass is £40 all the same; but as a rule it is
not worth while to acquire chipped or broken articles
of old glass.</p>


<h3>“TOUT PASSE, TOUT CASSE, TOUT LASSE”</h3>

<p>The French proverb tells us that everything passes,
everything breaks, everything wearies, at last. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
collector knows better than that; he prevents old works
of art and craft from passing altogether; he keeps them
safe from breaking, and he never wearies of adding to
them or studying them; as I hope this book may enable
many a collector to do.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
